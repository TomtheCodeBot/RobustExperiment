Virus-Free Macs  #147;The single most effective way to avoid viruses and spyware is to simply chuck Windows altogether and buy an Apple Macintosh, #148; writes Walt Mossberg in the Wall Street Journal.  #147;There has never been a successful virus written for Mac OS X, and there is almost no spyware that targets the Mac.
