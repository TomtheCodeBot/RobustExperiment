Is this the end of IT as we know it? Halsey Minor, CEO of hosted integration provider grand central Communications, has a powerful message for IT: In four years, ... basically the whole notion of enterprise application software is going to be dead. He believes application functionality will instead be available as hosted, pay-per-use services delivered by companies such as Salesforce.com. Putting his money where his mouth is, Minor has recently launched a \$50 million venture capital fund with his own money to fuel on-demand startups. For its part, Grand Central will handle data and process integration between enterprises and multiple on-demand services.
