So the food was decent, the service was absolutely terrible and I was charged for a soda when all I got was carbonated water... I asked why and the poor waiter said that when they don't charge for it, the owner takes it out of their check.. Are you kidding me? Not like I needed 2 dollars, and not like it was a big deal but it was when the waiter told me about the owner. I will never be back and don't recommend. It looks like they are struggling anyways so good luck attempting to obtain clients with the way you practice  your business and treat your employees. If you are the owner, and you want to reach out to me and talk about it let me know. I'd love to give you a piece of my mind.

We ordered take out from here for dinner last night. \n\nAfter paying our $70 tab (3 soups, 2 rolls), we opened the containers up at home to be incredibly disappointed. The soups were just ok, not the same quality as the first time, not horrible but just OK. \n\nThe sushi is where we were REALLY pissed off. $15/roll to get 6 pieces of what looks like BUDGET SUSHI. We could have gone to Yume Sushi and gotten a kick ass awesome sushi roll (or two!) for that price but apparently here, it gets you a 6 piece baked (microwaved) rice roll with hardly any other ingredients smothered in \""spicy\"" (not) mayo sauce with the teensiest bit of roe sprinkled on top. \n\nI'm not gonna lie, I TOTALLY felt downright ROBBED on this meal and I am not a happy camper about it. The food quality for the prices charged is insane. \n\nI won't be back.

Le Sainte Elisabeth is known for its legendary terrace. It's not as grand as the crazy one over at Saint-Sulpice, but its size and in-the-corner-ness does give it quite the kick.\n\nThe inside is pretty nice, and it's got that nice woody bar feeling you expect to see in a proper pub. If the first floor is full (and chances are it will be), there's also a pretty big second floor with much more space. The music at the place is pretty loud though, so you'll have to get pretty up-close-and-personal if you want to talk to someone.\n\nThey turned their fireplace on (with FIRE!) when I was there in the winter, and that was a pretty good spot to hang around until the staff forced us out cause we were blocking the entrance. Oh [[also]], just a heads up, the terrace is closed in the winter. \n\nThe entrance to the bar is in a small, fully graffiti'd alleyway off of St Catherine street.

The selection of their beers and [[beverages]] was [[extensive]].  \n\nSecondly, I cannot emphasize the importance for any business to focus on customer service.  The staff here had it down.  While it was a bit slow for a Friday night, the staff was eager to [[help]], taking the opportunity to focus on the customers.  I've been to many a bar where it's a slow night and the bar staff is too busy goofing off to pay [[attention]] to you.

Always stop here for a bag each of candy-shelled chocolate-covered peanuts and chocolate-covered almonds from the bulk section.  Love the organic Mountain Fresh and Brown Cow yogurts.  As for the produce I buy here, I must first say that I triple-, sometimes quadruple-inspect my options before I purchase at any grocery I shop at, and I've only had to complain about the strawberries here at Sunflower.  All other fruits and the veggies were fine.  Wish I could say the same about the other farmer's market whose name rhymes with snouts...\n\nDon't know if this place still sells Berto's gelato and Laloo's goat milk ice cream as it's been close to a year since I last purchased, but you must check these items out as they taste out-of-this-world!

This Checkers location is new to the area having only been open a few weeks at the time of this review.  It did not take me long to get there to give it a try though I did allow for the few weeks to pass giving the staff a chance to work out any glitches to their processs.  On my first of what will likely be many visits over the foreseeable future I went with my co-workers.  My boss ordered a BLT and the Baconzilla Fries.  The fries did not last long as she went hog wild on the cheesey bacon topped goodness.  The BLT, however, is still waiting for her.  Not because it is bad but because the fries were so good and so filling.  A different co-worker ordered the heart attack special with a side of all around good badness.  She got the Bacon Roadhouse Burger hold the BBQ sauce, a small order of seasoned fries and the Monsterella Cheese Sticks (fried mozarella).  It all looked great and she gave me the two thumbs up sign when I asked how she enjoyed it all.  That is a definitive win from her.  As for me, I ordered the double fish sandwich.  Think about a double Filet-O-Fish from McDonalds and add shredded lettuce.  It was about like that but by the time I got back to the office the fish had gone soggy and lost its crispy integrity.  I'll take McDonalds for the win on this one.  Besides, not [[much]] beats the bun McDonalds uses for their fish sandwich.  Anyhow, I also ordered the Fully Loaded Fries.  They are topped with melty cheese, ranch dressing and bacon bits (real bacon).  I ate about half before getting interrupted with work stuff so I set them aside and finished them the next day.  I liked the fries but they were very salty from being seasoned fries topped with cheese and bacon.  It was a little much but to at least have tried them I am happy.  Next time I go I may try either a chicken sandwich of some sort or perhaps one of the many burgers Checkers has to offer.  I would also try the cheese sticks.  They looked amazing and when dipped in marinara they must taste as good as they look.  I would also like to try some of the dessert options in the future.  They have some unique ice cream treats that sound incredible.  This food may not be good for the body but fast food rarely is.  This is food good for the mind.  You can't help but be happy at a place that serves up as much bacon as Checkers does.

Very terrible service. I booked and paid for three hotel rooms with 2 beds for my whole family with 8 people online.When we arrived to the hotel and we are getting ready to check in, they told me that there is no more 2 beds rooms available at this time. They only have 1 beds. They said tbey cannot gurantee the rooms !!! They even gave us wrong hotel keys to someone else's hotel room. We were so surprised walking into an occupied room. We had to come back to the front desk and file a complaint. We ended up taking the 1 beds room since the kids were tired. A few of us slept on the floor. I will never recommend coming back with such bad service they provided.

Food is alright, but you better set aside half of your day if you want to eat here. After waiting for 45 minutes for a table, food took another hour and then it took 30 minutes after finishing our breakfast to get our check. We had to flag down the hostess for drink refills and to take out credit card at the end.\n\nThe pros were that they do offer gluten free pancakes and waffles. I tried a Waffle which was just okay.. But it was nice to have GF option either way. Also, the fresh squeezed Oj was really good. The hostess and waiter were very friendly.. But I don't see myself coming back.. The wait was just ridiculous.

Went on Saturday 12/20/14 for lunch and the 3 of us were seated immediately which was nice, however, we ordered and waited an hour for our food while others around us who were seated after us were being served. Just as we were trying to track down an employee to call a manager to our table after waiting an hour for our food, the server walking towards us had 2 of our 3 plates. We asked him to have the manager come to our table and his response was \""but I have your food here, do you not want it?\"". One of my friends stated \""Surely, we will take the food but can you please still have a manager come see us?\"". We had no silverware to begin eating and waiting for the 3rd plate. We had to track down another waitress and ask for a manager again as some time had passed and there was still no manager in site, nor the 3rd plate of food. The 3rd plate of food finally came out and we asked for silverware and began eating. Throughout the meal, still no manager. The waiter (Carl) was nice and did come around a few times to ask if everything tasted ok. After we were completely done eating, still no manager. Carl came to the table and stated the kitchen was \""backed up and having issues\"" he then stated the assistant manager was the only one working that day and he/she couldn't step out as he/she was assisting the kitchen in getting back on track. He then stated he was able to comp us ($11.00) and apologized for the service. \n\nAs we knew it was not the waiter's fault, we were extremely disappointed in the hour wait, no silverware, and no manager after requesting he/she twice. The cherry on top was the fact that the assistant manager essentially could not come out for a few minutes to speak with a dissatisfied customer. Extremely unprofessional.

I was pressed for time and desperate for a fill since I couldn't get my regular Nail Technician at the salon I normally go to. I figured I would give this place a try, and it wasn't the worst, but it also wasn't the best.\n\nThe guy who did my nails seemed like he was so bored the entire time he was doing my nails. He wasn't friendly and he actually made me feel unwelcome. \n\nI had coffin style acrylics and he ended up messing up the shape of my pinkies as he was filing them down. They were obviously uneven, but I didn't bother asking him to fix it since I had to leave for work in about an hour anyways. \n\nTowards the end of my fill, he started asking me a little bit about myself and proceeded to ask me what I was interested in pursuing to which I replied, \""Cosmetology\"". \nHe actually stopped doing my nails and looked at me and said, \""You don't want to do this. Do something else.\"" He was a lot ruder about it and yes, I did find it very disrespectful. I understand we all have our bad days, but just because you're unhappy with your job doesn't mean you should put down someone else's idea for pursuing that career/goal.\n\nI normally tip very well and let's just say I didn't give him much and no, I will not be back.

I love Dillards, this location at PV Mall is smaller than the one I usually go to, but it does a decent job still putting out labels in their tiny Contemporary section , just in limited styles and quantities. The shoe department here, as previous reviewers have mentioned, is pretty awesome. This Dillards has a MAC makeup counter which is rad and today I noticed they have a  \""The Edge\"" beauty section. I was immediately attracted to the Too Faced brand displayed on the wall and noticed they also have Studio Gear, Murad, and some Philosophy products as well. This new addition is a big plus as I am always going between Ulta (which is across the street) and here for MAC products. Now I have the brands that I love all in one department store! Go Dillards! The children's and men's departments are rather large and of course they have a junior's and women's section.

I was at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort for a conference and I had paid for a booth in the Hohokam Ballroom for three days. During my stay my boothmate and I began receiving huge red itchy welts which were bug bites from insects in the ballroom. I went to the concierge who took me into the business center to speak with the manager Kyle King, who apologized and said he would immediately come down to the ballroom to assess the situation. Unfortunately nobody ever came to deal with the insect problem and we continued to receive bites and ended up with around a dozen bites each from our feet up to our knees. The bites were so itchy that they kept us both up at night for a week even while constantly applying medication. I later spoke with a nurse who said that they appeared to be flea bites and that the hotel needed to take action with the problem since flea bites can become infected from the feces fleas leave while on our skin and if they are scratched can lead to scarring.\n\nAfter the event, I called the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort and asked to speak to a manager about this issue. Nobody would connect me to a manager and asked why I needed to speak to a manager in the first place. I explained what had happened during my stay on the property and was told they would find the manager Kyle King I had spoken with and connect me to him. I was put on hold for more than ten minutes and then was told I was going to be connected to the Director of Security, who told me he would get Kyle King's contact information and call me back with that information so I could e-mail photographs of the bug bites I received from my stay on the property. The Director of Security called me back and said his boss wouldn't allow him to give me a managers contact information.\n\nAfter this I e-mailed the resort and was told that since I didn't pay to stay in a hotel room and only paid to stay in the Hohokam Ballroom that they couldn't do anything about it even though this happened on their property and they did nothing about it. And speaking of rooms, I later was informed that some individuals that stayed in hotel rooms on the property during the same time had issues with ants swarming in their rooms which ended up getting into their luggage.\n\nOverall I think it is ridiculous that the hotel wouldn't do anything about the bugs and also that nobody would let me speak to a manager when I had a complaint. I expected a clean and safe environment to be in at the resort, but the resort has bug problems in several different areas which need to be attended to for the safety and health of the guests.

The look of the hotel was very pretty..when [[the]] walked into our room there was a light, nice smelling scent. The room is definitely [[dry]] than most hotels I've been to. The decor was very [[plain]] as well. In the morning we got free breakfast that serves from 6-10am. Their breakfast was beyond what we were expecting. Very delicious with bacon, eggs, bagels, etc. I definitely would recommend [[even]] who's stopping by Scottsdale to try this hotel. Completely in love with it!

As an avid coffee fan, I have to say that Caribou has won me over. They have free Wi-Fi, which is great if you find yourself in the area and you need to do some work via computer. When you walk in the door, you feel like you've left the Southside and entered a cozy ski lodge. They even have a fireplace surrounded by big, comfy chairs -definitely a plus when you're looking for a place to relax and sip on some espresso. \n\nOne of the cool things about Caribou is that it has a wider variety of menu items than your typical coffee shop. The oatmeal (try their Blueberry Almond flavor, so good!), breakfast sandwiches and snacks are much better than what you can get at your local Starbucks. If you're not a coffee person, Caribou also has some really good flavored teas. Overall, a great place to get your caffeine fix.

I can't say enough about one hairstylist in particular. Julia is the ONLY one in Scottsdale who I trust to touch my lovely long locks. I've followed her from her previous Salon for 2 years. She listens to what I want, but also contributes suggestions. She is a color genius, creating stunning dimension that can be subtle for a less noticeable grow-out over time, or dramatic and bold. She is meticulous, and proud of her work. She also makes the time fly by making conversation and overall treating you like you're talking to a friend you've known for years. Overall time in the chair is a little long, but I'm willing to spend a few extra hours to walk out feeling like doing a Beyonce hair flip!

Ate there last night with a group of friends.  The waitstaff was friendly, but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night.  I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.  The fries that went along with it were also extremely salty.  A couple people in the group said their food was okay, but definitely not worth a trip back.  I was quite bummed about this.

Completely awful. \n\nThe scheduling was all messed up and they forced us to start early, which I am not holding against them in this review. They claim to have fired the person who caused this error.\n\nWe had a 1600 sq. ft. condo and just two people worth of stuff; no kids. Everything was already boxed, including the garage. Just move the boxes and the furniture to the truck, drive the truck from point A to point B, and unload the truck.\n\nThe first crew that arrived just after 11:00 and did nothing but load 2/3 of the garage for the first hour and a half while they \""waited for a second truck\"" because apparently we have too much stuff to fit in just one. I still got charged for this time. After 5 hours total at our old house, the moving company claimed they wanted to send a second crew of two guys out to make sure that the original two guys finished before 20:00. Now I have to pay for two crews worth of time. The second crew arrived and helped finish the master bedroom and we were finally loaded and moved on to the new house.\n\nAt the new house, all four guys took another 3 hours to unload all the furniture and put it in the proper rooms.\n\nThe wife was quite hungry and left for the new house ahead of me leaving the old house, and she got pizza for us and another for the movers. When we arrived at the new house, the movers spent 45 minutes eating pizza and standing around our kitchen talking about football. I didn't say anything at the time because I was hungry and eating as well, and I expected they wouldn't charge me for this time. WRONG. They charged me for the nearly full hour they spent eating my food. \n\nAfter over 8 full hours, three trucks (two of them 2/3 full and one completely empty) and two moving crews billed separately at the moving company's request we were finally moved. There was no damage done to any of our gear, and the movers themselves were quite pleasant. My biggest problem is that they moved slow and seemed to not care about time at the same time they were billing hourly. This is completely unacceptable. \n\nThe only issue I had with their treatment of my furniture is that they didn't care which way was right side up. They said we could leave our drawers full and they would just shrink-wrap them and move them in place, so that's exactly what we did. However because they were constantly moving them on edge or upside-down, all the things in the drawers ended up out of the drawers, so we had to physically remove the drawers, pick up all the jumbled contents of the drawers from the interior floor of the dresser, put the drawers back, and replace the contents of the drawers. This is worse than boxing it up and leaving the drawers empty!\n\nI moved into this house in just over 3 hours for just under $400 with 2 movers. There is zero reason that four men took roughly 8 hours and cost more than 4\u00d7 the price. A friend of ours moved a 3800 sq. ft. house full of furniture with this company in less time, for less money, and with a single crew of 2! \n\nI can not recommend against this company enough, regardless of how pleasant the actual movers were to deal with.

Malmaison (bad house) is about right, but MerdeMaison is much more fitting.  I was really looking forward to spending NYE in Edinburgh and thought this hotel would round out a fun holiday.  How wrong I was.  \n\nAt first glance, the place looks impressive with quirky, fun decor. But it's all about the details, isn't it?  While the room was well furnished and large, the phone didn't work at all through the entire stay (and nobody came to fix it after maintenance made an appearance on day 1). So every time we needed anything, we had to go down to the front desk (see detail on staff attitude later in this review).  In addition, the beds were like wooden planks. \n\nAnd the breakfast was AWFUL.  Food two of the days was only partially cooked and inedible.  I'd upgraded our initial rate to include a full breakfast as part of a NYE package -- the upgrade cost about $100 US for two guests for three days.  But when we got to the cafe we were told our package only included the continental choice and we'd have to pay extra for additional items.  Seriously ... that is expensive bread and pastry (which I don't even eat).  So the desk manager (I assume that was his title), after a discussion, told me he was only upgrading our breakfast package to include meat to keep me happy (delivered in a very snide tone and smirk -- complete with eye roll).\n\nWhich brings us to the hotel staff.  Most importantly to me, about 50 percent of staff was extremely rude -- beyond the norm of European travel. I can tolerate a little bit of sassy attitude, but this was shockingly insulting.\n\nLastly, I'd paid in full two months in advance of the stay only to be presented a bill for 10 percent more at checkout. The girl at the desk could not explain it, only point to line items and shrug.  I'm still not sure why I was charged the additional fee (probably a malicious mark-up for the inedible breakfast) ... I'll probably never know.\n\nI should have followed my instincts initially and booked the Balmoral.  Much more spendy, but worth every single penny.  \n\nI will NEVER again stay at a MerdeMaison property.  But as I don't think the Malmaison brand can possibly last with this type of service, hopefully nobody will have to.

Im a fan of the MGM Grand. They always have promotions going on for their rooms. Check out the vegas forums on fatwallet.com or just to the mgms website and take advantage of them. I got a double bed room, for 3 nights at a total of $390.00. \nEveryone here is relaxed, friendly and this place is HUGE. It has everything you will need. Has some amazing restaurants, fun gambling and casual atmosphere. Its not in your face or intiimdating. Its not stuck up like some others down the strip. \nMGM is a good value and comfortable. Wouldnt really go here for luxury per say, but the new Skylofts and the West Wing sound luxurious. Havent stayed in those yet. \nTheir pool complex is so big. They have 5 pools, a lazy river and new cool pool area. Like an outdoor club, but a heads up YOU HAVE TO PAY COVER :)\n\nGood- THEIR BEDS!!!!!!!!!  I wish I could take them home with me. So comfortable. Like Heaven. \nConceirge- Awesome people. I had them put balloons, a Happy Birthday banner and a flower in the room before we got there, and it was such a great surprise. They did it just right!\nAirport Checkin- WONDERFUL. This is the only hotel who has this at the Vegas airport. I checked in here so the conceirge could have a heads up that we were coming and have time to set everything up. The lovely man who helped me in the airport check in was so accomadating. At first I was hesitant to check in here because I thought I couldnt get the room I wanted, or you know...haggle like most people do at check in to get the perfect room they want. \nTHIS WAS EASIER. I got my Non-Smoking room, close to the elevator (actually the first one in the hall. If you have seen the LONG hallways at the MGM you know what Im talking about), high floor but a possible view. \nHE GAVE ME all that I wanted. This was a room that was \""blocked\"" in his system, but had the manager unblock it so he can give it to me. AWESOME. Will always check in for MGM this way. \nRIDE TO HOTEL- MGM is the first hotel when you exit the airport. Fare is like $15 (up to 5 ppl in a taxi). DOnt take the MGM shuttle which charges $15 per person, roundtrip. Taxi is cheaper. \nWe won some money, swam a lot, and relaxed. So much fun.

Unfortunately I had the worst customer service experience I have had in a really long time. I had to repeatedly ask for drink orders. My friend asked twice to place an order and the order got ignored. We tried to ask another waiter but when asked he said that we had to place it with our waiter and e was going to go get him. Twice we did this the waiter never came. TWO hours later we never got our drinks!!!\n\nIt was honestly the worst case of just not giving a F&#k by the employees there. \n\n\nThe only reason this place deserves a one star is because the food we had was good, even though ordering the food was also quite a challenge.

Gather around little Yelpers, let me tell you about my stay at ye ol' Treasure Island. No, but seriously get ready to hear it.\n\nWe had the penthouse suite here. Our room was beautifully decorated and looked real crisp. Being an all guys birthday weeknd, we wanted to go all out. As soon as entering the room, we immediately fired up the jacuzzi. And 10 minutes later there was water all over the floor due to my fellow comrade who thinks it's not a problem to cannonball indoors. The staff handled the situation pretty well actually. They hand soaked and air dryed the room while we were out and the room looked handy dandy when we returned that night.\n\nBeing a fairly rowdy group, being loud was a given. Things got a little wierd for us two days in. Our room was the first room on the hall we were in, and they actually had a person standing by our [[room]] 24/7. I asked why was this necessary, but the staff all told me they were doing what they were told by the relief and higher class. I'm conviced they were keeping an eye on us.\nThe pool area was [[exceptional]]. I mean, it's not a Wet Republic or Cancun, but it's a decent place to lounge around and sun bathe. The music selection was a hit or miss. Some days it was hopping and popping with an actual DJ, and some days it was like they were playing a radio. The drinks are actually really overpriced, but it is Vegas, so you can't really blame them. Anywho, the crowd here was pretty laid back and it was pretty obvious that everyone was hungover. We had brought a handle of Jameson down with us and had our own personal bar going. This goes against the rules, and the staff gave us a warning, but didn't confiscate the bottle until the second warning, when the bottle was already finished. We had forgotten our swimming wear back in the room, and made the executive decision to jump into the pool in our boxers. We weren't escorted out of the pool area, so i'm assuming this is okay if anyone considers this in the future.\n\nThe tables here are cursed, and do not pay out. Go somewhere else. No, but seriously, I had the worst luck on the tables. The cocktail waitresses returned fairly quickly with the water down drinks, and do not return to you if you don't tip them well. \n\nThe restauraunt selection here isn't the best. They have one place here open 24 hours that serves food that any late night diner would. We ate here a couple early mornings, and the food is as good as any drunk person looking for a quick bite would expect. The staff at the said restaurant were a hit and miss. Some were cooperative while others gave us the evil eye. My buddy and I came here one morning after a night of painting the town red, and we actually fell asleep after we ordered our food. After miserably failing to wake us up, the staff stored our food away until we woke up. No, they didn't remake our food, but instead saved it for us. I would've said something to them about giving us food that was not fresh, but during my sleep, I actually lost my phone and one of the employees here found my phone on the floor and returned it to me once I woke up. A truly sincere gesture when in Sin City. The food wasn't that good by the way.\n\nI felt bad for the maid that was in charge of cleaning our room. The pad looked like a tornado flew through it. After the second day I started tipping any houskeeper that passed by our room and showering them with compliments. It was the least I could do. Our room was always clean after we returned from the daily escapades, with the linen being fully stocked and our bathroom presentably clean. Nothing was stolen or taken either. \n\nWe ordered room service to go along with our pregame on one of the nights when we were getting ready. Aside from the aggressive lady that yelled at us because we took to long to order, the food was extroadinary. We ordered a bunch of finger food that cost us an arm and leg, but everyone was neatly wrapped and to my surprise, well prepared and cooked. \n\nLast but not least, the people in charge of customer service. We had initially asked for a room with a view of the strip, but we also really wanted a smoking room to hot box, but to our dismay, the only smoking room they had, did not have a strip view. So we ended up settling for the view of the not so infamous Trump Tower. My buddy who had initially booked the room, called customer service intoxicated, mind you. He complained to them about the hotel view we had and gave them a bogus story about how he was going to propose tomorrow night and needed a strip view. After speaking to many people he finally had a word with the manager who actually gave us a brand new penthouse with a strip view for our last day there. These people really made our trip memorable and cooperated with all our needs. \n\nI'm giving this place 4 stars because their are better places to stay at on the strip, but if you're not really trying to go all, this is not a bad hotel. It's also right next to the Wynn and Palazzo.

After speaking to many people he finally had a word with the manager who actually gave us a brand new penthouse with a strip view for our last day there. These people really made our trip memorable and cooperated with all our needs. \n\nI'm giving this place 4 stars because their are better places to stay at on the strip, but if you're not really trying to go all, this is not a bad hotel. It's also right next to the Wynn and Palazzo.

Well here we are again no call so I call the hotel again and speak with Tara director  of operations  explained again I have heard nothing from the hotel  in regards to what happened at there hotel with security  harassment against my father see said she was sorry and would get the head of security  on the phone I explained  that is not working nobody will call me back and give me a straight answer she stated I need to deal with them, I asked  if they report to the hotel and the answer was yes asked to put me on hold , head of security picked up the line and stated they reviewed the tape and nobody hit my father's legs or seemed to help him down the stairs funny since I asked them to review  the tapes when I was at the front desk and was told there was no video available as there is no cameras up stairs.  I asked them to send me the video and was told no and I would have to take there word for it, explained that I have 3 different witnesses that saw what happend I was told it doesn't matter it didn't happen,   I explained  there guards  had picked out and harassed my father on 2 different nights and asked them to review the tapes the day before they said they would and call me back the next day this has been a week and nothing what do I have to do to get some action.   Anybody have a idea to get there attention?  How do I get the hotel to take responsibility and step up.\n\nAm told the hotel reviews the yelp website  everyday and yet no replies or response

This business is BREAKING THE LAW by refusing service to same gender couples who want to legally marry in the state of Nevada. This business has a business license which legally requires it to offer the service they provide to ANYONE. These people are the worst kind of people, hiding behind religion as a reason to be hateful bigots who discriminate. Jesus by the way, did not say to not serve gay people.

I hate to be the one of [[unpopular]] opinion here, but my overall experience here wasn't that great. \n\nDrinks were decent, amuse bouche of asparagus mousse was pretty good, and the souffles were fabulous as described.\n\nHowever, [[neither]] of our entrees were good.

I really try and support local hardware retailers (granted this isn't local, but it's not \""big box\"") as I worked at a small chain back in school.  However I cringe when I have to go here, the staff hasn't been too friendly to me.\n\nI ordered something online and for the longest time the tracking simply said the item had been shipped, meanwhile I ordered something via Home Depot after ACE and it came before!  It seemed like the error was the store received the product but never scanned it in, thus I thought it was still in transit.\n\nThe past 2 times I've gone there, 15-20 min before closing, the employees are huddled at the front of the store and immediately ask me what I'm looking (in not the nicest tone) for because they close soon.  It just seems very pushy, as I'll go to Home Depot or Lowes 5 min before closing and I don't get asked.\n\nI most likely would have bought more items if I didn't feel like they wanted to shut up shop early for the night.  I'll continue to go here for items on my way home, but not for my main hardware needs.

We had been hearing rave reviews about this pizza and yelp has the reviews to back up what we were hearing.  The staff is super friendly.  One of the best things about this pizza place is that when there is a line to be seated you can pre order your pie so when you sit down you wait for food is very short.  It is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out.\n\nOn to the food.  Started with the 1/2 and 1/2 dinner salad.  The Italian dressing was just ok for me, but there was nothing wrong with it.  The 1/2 of spinach was non existent.  The pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed.  My biggest complaint about the pie was the sweet sauce.  So sweet in fact that I had to add salt to try to cut the sweetness.  Defiantly not my favorite pie.

OMG, are their ANY competent fast food places anymore? Two customers in the restaurant around 3pm'ish and THREE people behind the front counter with 4 more in the back kitchen area. No lie, it took these guys almost 9 minutes to put 10 pcs of chicken in a bucket and hand it to me! With my to-go order, no condiments, utensils, plates, napkins...nothing.

Linda is AMAZING, not only is she an amazing person but she is also awesome at scar revisions.  I have a dog bite scar from 1996 that went all the way to the bone that I am self-conscious about.  [[I]] saw a crazy deal on Living Social for skin needling, WHAT??? [[I]] had no idea what that even was but after talking to Linda on the phone for 20 minutes I felt confident that she could [[help]], at least, make the scar less noticeable. She never made promises that I felt like she could not keep, as in, she said it would be invisible or it would disappear, etc.  We are talking about a deep, old scar.  However, my scar looks AMAZING after 4 treatments.  It is flat, smaller and the discoloration is on the way to being gone.  I am beyond impressed with how it looks. I AM [[THRILLED]]! I get comments all the time from people that know me and say \""Is there something different?\"", it's crazy!!!\nNow that we have covered the skin needling, let's talk about the other services Linda offers.

My skin looks and feels amazing.  I have not ever been this happy with how my skin looks and feels.  I have less wrinkles, less middle age acne break outs and the texture of my skin is amazing.  \nLinda [[never]] over sells products or pushes things on you, so you never feel like you \""have to buy what she uses on you\"" like you do at some salons you visit.  She is one of the most [[genuine]] people you will ever meet and she will be honest about what she can and can not do to help you.  I really appreciated that when we started working on my scar.

Drove into Pittsburgh really late at night. So late the city had pretty much shut up shop. Walked around Station Square for literally an hour passing this place three times before finally having lost all sense of reason and succumbed to the kitsch seafood decor, flying shark with mardi-gras beads in its mouth and party lights. I am allergic to crab but thought hey you only live once right?! and ordered the lobster and king crab steam pot from the extra super buff teenage waiter whose shirt was so tight I could not understand how he could carry around a tray full of food. He was pleasant enough and although the place was practically empty he was never around when I wanted him and always around asking if I needed anything while I was stuffing my face full of sea creatures. The steampot was fine but the whole box of spices they add to it completely ruin the dish and I shudder to think they try to do that to hide how not-so-fresh the seafood is..ugh..Well I didn't have my face in a toilet or have exploding diarrhoea after or die from sea creature poisoning so there's a plus. The prices are really high for what they serve but Pittsburgh is pretty far from the ocean. On the plus side I love trains and you can sit right next to the train line and not even hear them pass every 20mins. Also the view across to the city is amazing across the river framed by the monumental massive amount of bridges and you are literally steps from the funicular to walk off your dinner. So whats the lesser of two evils this place or the Hard Rock Crappe next door?

Also no menu's, everything is written in chalk up on the wall which I personally didn't care for but it was original...kinda. Anyway I will return. Service was good, parking was easy.

We were really hoping this would be a great place.  It may be, but unfortunately, they forgot our order and we sat in a mostly empty restaurant for about 45 minutes wondering what happened to our sandwiches.  Ended up leaving hungry because we couldn't stay any longer.  They did credit us back for the entire meal, so that was good.  Maybe we'll try again??
