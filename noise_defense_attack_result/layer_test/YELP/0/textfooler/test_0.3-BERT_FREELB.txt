Just [[showed]] up to [[Phoenix]] with a buddy looking for a place to [[hang]] out that resembled the fabled Mort's [[Martini]] Bar of Wichita, Kansas.  I'm going to [[be]] residing here for a while, [[so]] [[I]] [[needed]] a place I could call home.  Magnums is [[quite]] a [[good]] location, and while it's no Mort's, it is [[definitely]] a [[place]] [[I]] could [[find]] myself [[quite]] [[often]].\[[n]]\nFirstly, let me [[tell]] you, [[finding]] a [[place]] where you can enjoy your [[cigar]] and a [[beverage]] at the same [[time]] is [[exceedingly]] hard to [[do]] in this modern day of social [[awareness]] and health babysitting.  If you [[show]] up at a [[cigar]] [[bar]], you should be [[able]] to [[enjoy]] it there.  \n\nWe found this place [[relatively]] [[easily]].  It's in a strip mall, but the interior is [[very]] comfortable.  The decor instantly made me feel [[welcome]] and at home.  The staff was [[welcoming]] as well.  They [[made]] [[sure]] to greet [[us]] as we [[walked]] in the [[door]], and the humidor is large.  The only downside is on the day we [[visited]] a majority of our [[favorites]] had been purchased by like [[minded]] [[patrons]].  [[The]] [[exterior]] of the [[place]] [[does]] not meet the interior.  (Insert Doctor Who \""It's bigger on the inside\"" reference.\n\nThe staff made some excellent suggestions on local brews, and if we wanted to, we could try out many of the beverages to see if we liked it before we bought it.  The selection of their beers and beverages was extensive.  \n\nSecondly, I cannot emphasize the importance for any business to focus on customer service.  The staff here had it down.  While it was a bit slow for a Friday night, the staff was eager to help, taking the opportunity to focus on the customers.  I've been to many a bar where it's a slow night and the bar staff is too busy goofing off to pay attention to you.  These guys were professional.\n\nThirdly, if you find yourself stranded in the beautiful deserts of Arizona, make sure and visit this place.  It's worth your time.  I will be back, and it's earned a five star from me.  Glad to have been here!\nThirdly,

I've been to La Fitness, Pure Fitness, and Bally's. I prefer 24 Hour Fitness to all of those. For one, it doesn't stink like sweaty balls when you walk in, this location is open 24 hours even on the weekends, and I hardly ever have to wait for my favorite machines. They keep the place fairly clean  although some of the machines (especially the ab blaster) could use some TLC. It's fun to people watch and there are some really sexy men that work out there, even more of an incentive.

What comes to mind when somebody mentions \""Whose Line Is It Anyway?\"" Laughter, right? Even side splitting comedy, unique scenarios and improvisation. Well, Jesterz is no different. Located in the Papago Plaza at the corner of McDowell and Scottsdale Road, the spot, called Theater 168 due to the location, is tucked into a retail plaza. Blink and you might miss it. Yet, once inside, don't let the decor (or lack thereof) fool you. This isn't about props and paint swatches. This is about comedy, performed on the fly with audience participation. \n\nCome prepared to laugh so hard, you almost choke on your gum, like I did. \n\nCome prepared to participate, to voice suggestions, topic ideas, emotions.\n\nWatch a cohesive team of jesterz weave together comedy - right before your eyes! \n\nIt's suitable for all ages and is an absolutely perfect date idea. Or, go with friends and family. Bottom line: Just go. You'll leave feeling cheerful and energized. And, if you're like me, you'll be talking about the jokes, the comedy, the laughter, the fun for days and days... so much so that you'll want to go back!\n\nBasic info:\nThe Jester'Z perform every Friday and Saturday night at 8:00 & 10pm at Theater 168. Tickets are $12 for the 8pm show and $10 for the 10pm. There is no age restriction and never a drink minimum. (Concessions available at the snack bar)

I'm not sure what happened to this place, but over the last 6 months it has taken several steps in the wrong direction. The quality of the food is the only reason this is a two start review, and not a one star. The service is getting slower every visit, and the pricing fluctuations are ridiculous. The once $.99 breakfast biscuits are now $2.99. Two hundred percent increase in less than 6 months!

Asian buffets scare me... I usually don't know what half the stuff is, and if I do know what it is, it's a microwaved crazy sauced version of what I'm used to. Granted, I came here with a hungry hoard of UCSD dragon boaters, so we were all starved from a long day of paddling. Yes, I ate, but I was terrified that everyone would be sitting on a toilet for the rest of the night and that we would be totally unable to paddle our races the next day.\n\nMicrowavable edamame was my friend since I saw the costco sized bags sitting on the side (I figured I'd be safe with these), and I attempted to try everything else like the random seafoods, [[mushy]] sushi, and fatty meats. Their [[desserts]] were weird generic cakes that seemed to be salvaged from the sale section of the local grocery bakery, so I stuck with the frozen yogurt.\n\nLots of better options out there, but I guess since there were about 50 of us, we were limited.

With that said, I have an awesome (but very rare) European diesel version with a 2.8 liter VMotori  turbo diesel.  The Jeep dealers hate it because they don't really have any true diesel techs. The big diesel specialists only know Ford, Dodge, and Chevy and don't understand small European diesels. I found these guys on a Jeep CRD forum recommending them for local shop that will do honest, high quality work. (And the owner's wife has the same CRD Jeep as me, so he knows it top to bottom.)\n\nThere is no one else in the state of Arizona that I trust to work on my little Jeep. End of story.

Always stop here for a bag each of candy-shelled chocolate-covered peanuts and chocolate-covered almonds from the bulk section.  Love the organic Mountain Fresh and Brown Cow yogurts.  As for the produce I buy here, I must first say that I triple-, sometimes quadruple-inspect my options before I purchase at any grocery I shop at, and I've only had to complain about the strawberries here at Sunflower.  All other fruits and the veggies were fine.  Wish I could say the same about the other farmer's market whose name rhymes with snouts...\n\nDon't know if this place still sells Berto's gelato and Laloo's goat milk ice cream as it's been close to a year since I last purchased, but you must check these items out as they taste out-of-this-world!  The prices are also very wallet-friendly compared to AJ's, but really, that goes without saying, doesn't it?

This Checkers location is new to the area having only been open a few weeks at the time of this review.  It did not take me long to get there to give it a try though I did allow for the few weeks to pass giving the staff a chance to work out any glitches to their processs.  On my first of what will likely be many visits over the foreseeable future I went with my co-workers.  My boss ordered a BLT and the Baconzilla Fries.  The fries did not last long as she went hog wild on the cheesey bacon topped goodness.  The BLT, however, is still waiting for her.  Not because it is bad but because the fries were so good and so filling.  A different co-worker ordered the heart attack special with a side of all around [[good]] badness.  She got the Bacon Roadhouse Burger hold the BBQ sauce, a small order of seasoned fries and the Monsterella Cheese Sticks (fried mozarella).  It all looked great and she gave me the two thumbs up sign when I asked how she enjoyed it all.  That is a definitive win from her.  As for me, I ordered the double fish sandwich.  Think about a double Filet-O-Fish from McDonalds and add shredded lettuce.  It was about like that but by the time I got back to the office the fish had gone soggy and lost its crispy integrity.  I'll take McDonalds for the win on this one.  Besides, not much beats the bun McDonalds uses for their fish sandwich.  Anyhow, I also ordered the Fully Loaded Fries.  They are topped with melty cheese, ranch dressing and bacon bits (real bacon).  I ate about half before getting interrupted with work stuff so I set them aside and finished them the next day.  I liked the fries but they were very salty from being seasoned fries topped with cheese and bacon.  It was a little much but to at least have tried them I am happy.  Next time I go I may try either a chicken sandwich of some sort or perhaps one of the many burgers Checkers has to offer.  I would also try the cheese sticks.  They looked amazing and when dipped in marinara they must taste as good as they look.  I would also like to try some of the dessert options in the future.  They have some unique ice cream treats that sound incredible.  This food may not be good for the body but fast food rarely is.  This is food good for the mind.  You can't help but be happy at a place that serves up as much bacon as Checkers does.

Ehh... I would have rather went to McDonalds or In-n-Out down the street. The Buffalo chicken sandwich was very mediocre and the fries were very low quality. My friend got a burger that was dry and very small for $10. Service was great though and it is a great location right on the strip but if you want to pay 18 a person for mediocre food then this place is for you. I would advise going elsewhere.

NISHisHOT doesn't take shit from NOBODY.\n\nNO body.\n\nEspecially at restaurants.\n\nSo if you want to offer a ginger infused lychee martini.  And it tastes like the vodka that comes straight out of my freezer.  Well . . . \n\nIt SUCKS.  It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen. \n\nAnd if you want to offer Mackerel on your sushi menu that's as stale as the Talk Threads on Yelp.  Well . . . \n\nIt's UNACCEPTABLE.  It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen.\n\nBut if you offer. . . tiradito and lobster and oysters and sashimi and black cod and lions and tigers and a baby gorilla (it's Vegas, baby.

A couple mishaps that got sent back to the kitchen and off the check.   But the other food more than made up for it.  Including the baby gorilla.  And the excellent, good looking service.\n\nAnd about that check.  Well.  Shocking.  Stabbing.  No that's not my heart.  It's my wallet exploding.\n\nSo  . . . 5 Stars to my boyfriend for always knowing that I'm always better at being a drama mamma than ever paying for dinner.  \n\n(Okay!

My family and I were in town for my nieces college graduation. The waitress at Joes Crab Shack told us to try Poppys because it was last call at Joes (that's how we roll). Being responsible and not driving intoxicated we walked down and was not disappointed. Fran was very accommodating to our party and even opened the kitchen up for our late night munchies.

Excellent, flavorful, spicy, authentic Szechuan fare and hearty servings. The hot & sour soup was loaded with tofu, egg, veggies as it should be and plenty of flavor, not just pepper. We loved the eggplant and garlic,sweet, spicy and tender. The flaming chicken is terrific, with wonderful vegetables, aromatics and plenty of pepper oil and red peppers. The tea smoked duck was a bit too salty and the skin was not as crispy as I would have liked but edible. We look forward to, our next visit.

I love Dillards, this location at PV Mall is smaller than the one I usually go to, but it does a decent job still putting out labels in their tiny Contemporary section , just in limited styles and quantities. The shoe department here, as previous reviewers have mentioned, is pretty awesome. This Dillards has a MAC makeup counter which is rad and today I noticed they have a  \""The Edge\"" beauty section. I was immediately attracted to the Too Faced brand displayed on the wall and noticed they also have Studio Gear, Murad, and some Philosophy products as well. This new addition is a big plus as I am always going between Ulta (which is across the street) and here for MAC products. Now I have the brands that I love all in one department store! Go Dillards!

Flip to the back and see the last 30 pages or so.  Multiply by the number of cosmetic surgery ads and bar/club ads and you've got a lofty quotient.  The party pics are usually why people check it out.  Kind of like when married men say they read Playboy for the articles.  RIIIGGHHT!!\n\nThey are starting to cover Phoenix and Tempe a bit more than in the past, but it's primarily a Scottsdale 20-something society/nightlife magazine.\n\nPlus if you want to see a magazine clown and insult its unsuspecting and not-so-bright readers, check out the Letters to the Editor.

[[Completely]] [[awful]]. \n\nThe scheduling was all messed up and they forced us to start early, which I am not holding against them in this review. They claim to have fired the person who caused this error.\n\nWe had a 1600 sq. ft. condo and just two people worth of stuff; no kids. Everything was already boxed, including the garage. Just [[move]] the boxes and the furniture to the truck, drive the truck from point A to point B, and unload the truck.\n\nThe first crew that arrived just after 11:00 and [[did]] nothing but load 2/3 of the garage for the first hour and a half while they \""waited for a second truck\"" because apparently we have too much stuff to fit in just one. I still got charged for this time. After 5 hours total at our old house, the moving company claimed they wanted to send a second crew of two guys out to make sure that the original two guys finished before 20:00. Now I have to pay for two crews worth of time. The second crew arrived and helped finish the master bedroom and we were finally loaded and moved on to the new house.\n\nAt the new house, all four guys took another 3 hours to unload all the furniture and put it in the proper rooms.\n\nThe wife was quite hungry and left for the new house ahead of me leaving the old house, and she got pizza for us and another for the movers. When we arrived at the new house, the movers spent 45 minutes eating pizza and standing around our kitchen talking about football. I didn't say anything at the time because I was hungry and eating as well, and I expected they wouldn't charge me for this time. WRONG. They charged me for the nearly full hour they spent eating my food. \n\nAfter over 8 full hours, three trucks (two of them 2/3 full and one completely empty) and two moving crews billed separately at the moving company's request we were finally moved. There was no damage done to any of our gear, and the movers themselves were quite pleasant. My biggest problem is that they moved slow and seemed to not care about time at the same time they were billing hourly. This is completely unacceptable. \n\nThe only issue I had with their treatment of my furniture is that they didn't care which way was right side up. They said we could leave our drawers full and they would just shrink-wrap them and move them in place, so that's exactly what we did. However because they were constantly moving them on edge or upside-down, all the things in the drawers ended up out of the drawers, so we had to physically remove the drawers, pick up all the jumbled contents of the drawers from the interior floor of the dresser, put the drawers back, and replace the contents of the drawers. This is worse than boxing it up and leaving the drawers empty!\n\nI moved into this house in just over 3 hours for just under $400 with 2 movers. There is zero reason that four men took roughly 8 hours and cost more than 4\u00d7 the price. A friend of ours moved a 3800 sq. ft. house full of furniture with this company in less time, for less money, and with a single crew of 2! \n\nI can not recommend against this company enough, regardless of how pleasant the actual movers were to deal with.

[[Heartily]] [[frightful]]. \n\nThe scheduling was all messed up and they forced us to start early, which I am not holding against them in this review. They claim to have fired the person who caused this error.\n\nWe had a 1600 sq. ft. condo and just two people worth of stuff; no kids. Everything was already boxed, including the garage. Just [[evolving]] the boxes and the furniture to the truck, drive the truck from point A to point B, and unload the truck.\n\nThe first crew that arrived just after 11:00 and [[enjoys]] nothing but load 2/3 of the garage for the first hour and a half while they \""waited for a second truck\"" because apparently we have too much stuff to fit in just one. I still got charged for this time. After 5 hours total at our old house, the moving company claimed they wanted to send a second crew of two guys out to make sure that the original two guys finished before 20:00. Now I have to pay for two crews worth of time. The second crew arrived and helped finish the master bedroom and we were finally loaded and moved on to the new house.\n\nAt the new house, all four guys took another 3 hours to unload all the furniture and put it in the proper rooms.\n\nThe wife was quite hungry and left for the new house ahead of me leaving the old house, and she got pizza for us and another for the movers. When we arrived at the new house, the movers spent 45 minutes eating pizza and standing around our kitchen talking about football. I didn't say anything at the time because I was hungry and eating as well, and I expected they wouldn't charge me for this time. WRONG. They charged me for the nearly full hour they spent eating my food. \n\nAfter over 8 full hours, three trucks (two of them 2/3 full and one completely empty) and two moving crews billed separately at the moving company's request we were finally moved. There was no damage done to any of our gear, and the movers themselves were quite pleasant. My biggest problem is that they moved slow and seemed to not care about time at the same time they were billing hourly. This is completely unacceptable. \n\nThe only issue I had with their treatment of my furniture is that they didn't care which way was right side up. They said we could leave our drawers full and they would just shrink-wrap them and move them in place, so that's exactly what we did. However because they were constantly moving them on edge or upside-down, all the things in the drawers ended up out of the drawers, so we had to physically remove the drawers, pick up all the jumbled contents of the drawers from the interior floor of the dresser, put the drawers back, and replace the contents of the drawers. This is worse than boxing it up and leaving the drawers empty!\n\nI moved into this house in just over 3 hours for just under $400 with 2 movers. There is zero reason that four men took roughly 8 hours and cost more than 4\u00d7 the price. A friend of ours moved a 3800 sq. ft. house full of furniture with this company in less time, for less money, and with a single crew of 2! \n\nI can not recommend against this company enough, regardless of how pleasant the actual movers were to deal with.

As an avid coffee fan, I have to say that Caribou has won me over. They have free Wi-Fi, which is great if you find yourself in the area and you need to do some work via computer. When you walk in the door, you feel like you've left the Southside and entered a cozy ski lodge. They even have a fireplace surrounded by big, comfy chairs -definitely a plus when you're looking for a place to relax and sip on some espresso. \n\nOne of the cool things about Caribou is that it has a wider variety of menu items than your typical coffee shop. The oatmeal (try their Blueberry Almond flavor, so good!), breakfast sandwiches and snacks are much better than what you can get at your local Starbucks. If you're not a coffee person, Caribou also has some really good flavored teas. Overall, a great place to get your caffeine fix.

I absolutely love this hotel. When my boyfriend and I checked in they asked us if we wanted watered bottles, which was really  nice. The look of the hotel was very pretty..when I walked into our room there was a light, nice smelling scent. The room is definitely cleaner than most hotels I've been to. The decor was very pretty as well. In the morning we got free breakfast that serves from 6-10am. Their breakfast was beyond what we were expecting. Very delicious with bacon, eggs, bagels, etc. I definitely would recommend anyone who's stopping by Scottsdale to try this hotel. Completely in love with it! Oh and one more thing, we booked through Expedia so our one bed-room was only 40 dollars (tax included) for a Friday night. How cheap is that for such a nice hotel? Definitely go there!

I got the chicken salad to go and was a [[little]] [[put]] off when the chef reached into the under counter cooler and pulled out a plastic pre packed salad.  I was getting a diet coke also which came up to 15, but the combo was only a dollar more and comes with chips and fruit. \n\nTo my [[surprise]] the salad was quite good with the balsamic dressing. There's real chunks of chicken so it's not like it came out of a can. Now I have a banana for tomorrow morning also!

I went to this venue for the Carnivore's tour last month and was really pleased with my experience again. This time when I went, we were in a slightly different section and the lighting was WAY better. The line of sight to the show was great, and although I'd prefer to be closer to the stage, it was a great experience. Awesome show, great accommodations.

[[We]] order from here very regularly. Their $6 large cheese pizza deal is great. The sauce is [[fresh]] and sweet. Most [[certainly]] a great improvement from other pizza places $5 pizza deals on campus.\n\nTheir other menu items are a little overpriced in my opinion.

Malmaison ([[bad]] house) is about right, but MerdeMaison is [[much]] more fitting.  I was really looking forward to spending [[NYE]] in Edinburgh and thought this hotel would round out a fun holiday.  How [[wrong]] I was.  \n\nAt first glance, the place [[looks]] impressive with quirky, fun decor. But it's all about the details, isn't it?  [[While]] the room was well furnished and large, the phone didn't work at all through the entire stay (and nobody came to fix it after maintenance made an appearance on day 1). So every time we needed anything, we had to go down to the front desk (see detail on staff attitude later in this review).  In addition, the [[beds]] were like wooden planks. \n\nAnd the breakfast was [[AWFUL]].  Food two of the days was only partially cooked and inedible.  I'd upgraded our initial rate to include a full breakfast as part of a [[NYE]] package -- the upgrade cost about $100 US for two guests for three days.  But when we got to the cafe we were told our [[package]] only included the continental choice and we'd have to pay extra for additional items.  Seriously ... that is expensive bread and pastry (which I don't even eat).  So the desk manager (I assume that was his title), after a discussion, told me he was only upgrading our breakfast package to include meat to keep me happy (delivered in a very snide tone and smirk -- complete with eye roll).\n\nWhich brings us to the hotel staff.  Most importantly to me, about 50 percent of staff was extremely rude -- beyond the norm of European travel. I can tolerate a little bit of sassy attitude, but this was shockingly insulting.\n\nLastly, I'd paid in full two months in advance of the stay only to be presented a bill for 10 percent more at checkout. The girl at the desk could not explain it, only point to line items and shrug.  I'm still not sure why I was charged the additional fee (probably a malicious mark-up for the inedible breakfast) ... I'll probably never know.\n\nI should have followed my instincts initially and booked the Balmoral.  Much more spendy, but worth every single penny.  \n\nI will NEVER again stay at a MerdeMaison property.  But as I don't think the Malmaison brand can possibly last with this type of service, hopefully nobody will have to.

I can't say enough about one hairstylist in particular. Julia is the ONLY one in Scottsdale who I trust to touch my lovely long locks. I've followed her from her previous Salon for 2 years. She listens to what I want, but also contributes suggestions. She is a color genius, creating stunning dimension that can be subtle for a less noticeable grow-out over time, or dramatic and bold. She is meticulous, and proud of her work. She also makes the time fly by making conversation and overall treating you like you're talking to a friend you've known for years. Overall time in the chair is a little long, but I'm willing to spend a few extra hours to walk out feeling like doing a Beyonce hair flip!

the cocktails are great. fresh ingredients. can't go wrong with letting the bartender choose your drink or make an off-the-menu concoction inspired by your likes.\n\nthey've mastered the speakeasy theme; their decor aligns making you feel as if you're sitting in a forgotten library.\n\nwhen last we were there, the bartender shared that GQ had recently featured a cocktail on their menu. i can't remember its name, but it was tasty. \n\ndefinitely a breath of fresh air and provides huge contrast to its upstairs firehouse scene.

Ate there last night with a group of friends.  The waitstaff was friendly, but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night.  I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.  The fries that went along with it were also extremely salty.  A couple people in the group said their food was okay, but definitely not worth a trip back.  I was quite bummed about this.

Nice little Japanese restaurant that has awesome food and awesome sake. Been quite frequenting this place cause my gf and I love Japanese food. If ur in the mood for a Japanese food and want to avoid Ichiza type of ambiance, this nice relaxed restaurant is the spot. Price is reasonable and the service is way above par. Miyuki is the manager and goes above and beyond. Open really late which is always good and their J's Sake Bar(next door) is always a hit if u wanna try many different flavors of sake

As I write this Im a student here with a couple months left before Im done. [[Dont]] [[come]] here. Im a Vet so I used my GI Bill meaning I didnt have to pay to come here for the welding program. Its about 20,000 to come take a 10 month course to learn 4 types of welding. Thats not good. You can go to the Maricopa Skill Center and learn the same thing for 10,000 and thats for a 17 month course. And good [[luck]] using your \""credits\"" anywhere else if you come here because its a for profit school. Do your research please. This was just the closest place to my house.

What a great date spot! So romantic....I could see the Match.com love in the air.....  I have been here over the years several times (no not for Match!), and again last night due to a citipass bogo coupon. It is much better than I remembered!  My friend and I shared the chicken and andouille sausage soup which was DIVINE ($4). I had the chicken marsala and my friend had the seafood risotto. The marsala was probably enough for two people - it was a huge plate of fettuccine with two grilled chicken breasts and a ton of mushrooms. Thank god they are smart enough to do fresh (not canned) mushrooms. So perfect. \n\nThe seafood risotto was very good- it came with 6 mussels plopped on top which were lightly seasoned. My friend said some of the scallops in the risotto were a tiny bit tough but overall it was excellent. Entrees were about 13 bucks a piece, very worth the price! I will definitely be back!!! :-D

Hello all you foodies out there :)\n\nToday I will give you our opinion of JOES BBQ.\n\nAnd I do [[realize]] food is a preference and I am a very picky person.\n\nI realize Joes has its local following, however from a girl who has tried many of the BBQ joynts here in the greater Phoenix area I have to say.... I DONT [[GET]] IT?\n\nI was being fair in trying Joes twice.....just to make sure it wasent an off day.\n\nWe first went to Joes pick up window a few weeks ago and tried a slab of ribs and a combo plate with chicken, ribs and some bbq beef and bbq pork.\n\nI enjoy some good \""fall off the bone\"" ribs but what I got was a slab of \""pry off the bone\"" ribs.\n\nI must say the bbq sauce was ok but the meat was [[tough]] and chewy and I was extremely dissapointed.\n\nOn the combo place the chicken was [[dry]] as were the meats.\n\nI would like to compliment the MAC and CHEESE which is better than most and the BBQ BEANS were also tasty.\n\nI called  Joes to ask if I could bring back the ribs, of which I ate 2 bones, and get our money back and I was transfered to a very friendly manager who talked me into letting her send us a gift card so we can try again.\n\nShe insisted their ribs are normally \""fall off the bone\"".\n\nI told her I would prefer to bring back the food so she can see for herself what we spent good money on, but she talked me into trying again.\n\nOk, so here it is a few weeks later and we happen to be on Gilbert Rd and decided to  try again.\n\nWe got a 1/4 pd bbq beef sandwich and a 1/3 pd bbq pork sandwich.\n\nThe order taker gave a choice of sliced pork or chopped of which I prefer chopped.\n\nWhen we got home what we had was a bun and in a seperate styrofoam container a slop of what I am assuming was the bbq beef that looked disgusting and tasted equally as disgusting.\n\nNO bbq sauce on the side!\n\nThe bbq pork was plain, dry,  big hard hunks of pork and only one small side of bbq sauce, not nearly enough to wet the pork or even cover the pork.\n\nBoth sandwiches were thrown away... \n\nFor dinner we ate mac and cheese and a small side of bbq beans.\n\nSo now I have to ask again.....PEOPLE..... PLEASE get in your car and drive into Phoenix to BOBBY Q's BBQ and give their food a try.\n\nI realize we all want a good place close to home but Joe's simply doesn't do it for us.\n\nLuckily the gift card we received is also good at JOES farmhouse grill...which is a fun place to visit, otherwise we would have sent the card back with a \""thanks...but no thanks.... even free it's not worth it!\n\nWe would rather drive 1/2 hour to BOBBY Q's and enjoy some real good BBQ.\n\nYou can look back at my review of BOBBY Q's.  \n\nWe went there many times and have NEVER been dissapointed and I am a TOUGH critic!\n\nI would suggest if you decide to eat at Joe's, try the root beer...it is quite good!\n\nIf you enjoy corn bread..... dont eat it here...it is $2.29 for a small square of thin corn bread.  The taste is ok, but not at all worth the price.\n\nAnd so I repeat.... I DONT GET IT!  nor do I like it! Nor will be back or recommend  Joe's to anyone.\n\nThis is just 2 peoples opinion, but as I always suggest.... give it a try and see what you think, and before you make a decision...try BOBBY Q's and compare.\n\nAnd until you do......\n\nBon Appetite'

[[Do]] not [[go]] to this urgent [[care]] [[center]] if you value you or your family's [[health]] or even [[life]]. \n\nMy family and I were in [[Las]] Vegas for [[vacation]] [[last]] [[week]]. [[On]] Saturday, I [[took]] my two years [[old]] to that place since he is having fever for a couple of days and we could not bring the [[fever]] down with [[Tylenol]]. The [[doctor]] there could not see what [[inside]] my son's [[ears]] [[clearly]] and my son did not want to [[open]] his month either for the doctor to see his throat. [[The]] [[doctor]] then said \""[[let]] just [[give]] him some [[antibiotics]] for [[precaution]]\"".  I [[told]] the doctor that we will [[leave]] [[Las]] [[Vegas]] for home the second [[day]].  I told him there are CVS and walgreen [[near]] the [[hotel]] we [[stay]]. I [[took]] the [[prescription]] to both CVS and walgreen and none of them carry this [[antibiotics]]! The [[lady]] in walgreen [[said]] they [[have]] to [[order]] this if [[I]] [[really]] [[want]] it. [[It]] [[seems]] the doctor has no idea what the [[pharmacy]] [[normally]] [[carry]]. This is not the [[worst]] part yet.\n\[[nI]] called the [[doctor]] and [[asked]] for a [[replacement]] [[antibiotics]]. The [[nurse]] [[said]] they can not fax the new prescription to me. it is their policy not to do this. I have to either go there to pick it up or ask the pharmacy to call them. I did not rent a car so I decided to ask the pharmacy to give him a call.\n\nThe lady in walgreen called the doctor. it seemed the doctor yelled at her over the phone. she said the doctor is mean and prefer not to talk to him any more. Anyway, the new prescription asked for 200mg azithromycin. My son needs to take it twice a day and 5ml each time. The lady in the walgreen said she only has four bottles of this type of medicine and each only only has 22.5mg. I was surprised that the total amount of antibiotics my son has to take. So, I questioned the doctor over the phone. I had to wait two hours to get a chance to take to the nurse. The nurse said the doctor said it is correct! I still had doubt since even my insurance said the maximum is .75 something(?) and special manual override is needed if more is prescribed by the doctor.  Then the doctor said he wants to talk to the pharmacist. I gave my phone to the pharmacist. I guess the doctor yelled at her again. The pharmacist asked me why I was trying to give her a hard time? I was surprised by her question. All I want to do is to verify the total amount of antibiotics is correct and don't want to overdose my son. In the end, I said I only need two days' worth and I will get the rest when I get back home. For whatever reason, she gave me two bottles which is four days' worth. (about 45mg total). \n\nA couple of days after I got back home, I took my son to his regular pediatrics since he is still having cough and also I was wondering if I need to get the rest antibiotics from walgreen. fortunately, I did take him to his pediatrics. The pediatrics said the concentra doctor clearly did not know what he is doing and need to go back to school to learn again. for this type of antibiotics and for my son's age, he only need to take one teaspoon (5ml) a day for five days (total 25ml). Since my son has been taking the antibiotics for almost three days (30ml), we should stop give him more antibiotics. He had enough already. This antibiotics he took will stay and last for another several days. \n\nThe doctor in concentra asked my son to take  4~5 times more antibiotics than he should. It is insane. Also, his attitude to the pharmacist in walgreen was really bad. I hope there is something I can do to stop him from hurting other people. To leave a proper review here, I think, is the least I can do for now.

[[Could]] not [[wanting]] to this urgent [[loving]] [[heartland]] if you value you or your family's [[heath]] or even [[resided]]. \n\nMy family and I were in [[El]] Vegas for [[leaving]] [[final]] [[cabbage]]. [[Through]] Saturday, I [[became]] my two years [[ancient]] to that place since he is having fever for a couple of days and we could not bring the [[infection]] down with [[Suppositories]]. The [[corpsman]] there could not see what [[under]] my son's [[straps]] [[ostensibly]] and my son did not want to [[start]] his month either for the doctor to see his throat. [[A]] [[doctors]] then said \""[[enabling]] just [[enable]] him some [[bacterium]] for [[alerted]]\"".  I [[apprise]] the doctor that we will [[enabled]] [[Ciudad]] [[Rivera]] for home the second [[moment]].  I told him there are CVS and walgreen [[beside]] the [[barracks]] we [[keeping]]. I [[been]] the [[recipe]] to both CVS and walgreen and none of them carry this [[paracetamol]]! The [[consort]] in walgreen [[affirmed]] they [[attained]] to [[writ]] this if [[you]] [[precisely]] [[dreamed]] it. [[What]] [[hopes]] the doctor has no idea what the [[storehouse]] [[historically]] [[assumes]]. This is not the [[toughest]] part yet.\n\[[pero]] called the [[acupuncturist]] and [[prays]] for a [[alternate]] [[paracetamol]]. The [[healthcare]] [[confirmed]] they can not fax the new prescription to me. it is their policy not to do this. I have to either go there to pick it up or ask the pharmacy to call them. I did not rent a car so I decided to ask the pharmacy to give him a call.\n\nThe lady in walgreen called the doctor. it seemed the doctor yelled at her over the phone. she said the doctor is mean and prefer not to talk to him any more. Anyway, the new prescription asked for 200mg azithromycin. My son needs to take it twice a day and 5ml each time. The lady in the walgreen said she only has four bottles of this type of medicine and each only only has 22.5mg. I was surprised that the total amount of antibiotics my son has to take. So, I questioned the doctor over the phone. I had to wait two hours to get a chance to take to the nurse. The nurse said the doctor said it is correct! I still had doubt since even my insurance said the maximum is .75 something(?) and special manual override is needed if more is prescribed by the doctor.  Then the doctor said he wants to talk to the pharmacist. I gave my phone to the pharmacist. I guess the doctor yelled at her again. The pharmacist asked me why I was trying to give her a hard time? I was surprised by her question. All I want to do is to verify the total amount of antibiotics is correct and don't want to overdose my son. In the end, I said I only need two days' worth and I will get the rest when I get back home. For whatever reason, she gave me two bottles which is four days' worth. (about 45mg total). \n\nA couple of days after I got back home, I took my son to his regular pediatrics since he is still having cough and also I was wondering if I need to get the rest antibiotics from walgreen. fortunately, I did take him to his pediatrics.

[[I]] came to this place because its close to my home and I know someone that went here and her hair turned out nice so I tried it out. I initially wanted to get highlights and cut I showed the receptionist a picture and the hairstylist. I [[basically]] told her this is what I want. [[When]] I finally [[say]] down she explained to me the process before she started she offered me a \""great deal\"" includes hair treatments or conditioning with cut and color/highlights for $175. To be [[honest]] with you I have never paid that much to get my hair done. Anyways, she [[told]] me before she starts that I have to sign this paper to pretty much proves that I agree that I'm paying $175. So when she started she cut my hair first which turned out [[ok]]. Because I usually just get my trim before doing anything. [[Then]] after that she [[started]] [[showing]] me swatches on what she thought my hair would look nice in. I showed her the picture of how I want the color again and she [[kept]] on insisting on chili when The picture looks like blonde brown and light brown. I told her I want what I see in the picture.. After a long process of being in the dryer and washer I thought that the color is finally showing up because she showed a little bit if the strip of my hair. Long story short, nothing changed! I got the hair cut! She offered me products and I bought one! But the color stayed the same from when I came in. I love how she went step by step before she did my hair and she said in time it will slowly lighten but honesty I paid $200+ to make my hair look like something got done and it was such waste. I called the salon the next day because how upset I was. & i wanted to get my hair fixed..And the receptionist said that Sebastian is not in and my hair lady was off as well. And she was going to leave a note to let him know to call me back. So finally the next day came.. I called again Another receptionist answered and she said she thinks Sebastian might not be in today or if he is maybe later in today... Seriously I paid $200+ to get something done and the service is horrible. So for now that's my review on this place! I'll update you if Sebastian ever calls me.. 4/12/13. P.S I'm doing my review in my cellphone so there's some that's misspelled or typed incorrectly in sorry because I'm trying to get this review ASAP. Thanks!\n\n*** December 13, 2013*******\nOk, so it took me a while to get back on updating this review, So a week later I finally got a hold of Sebastian from Amnesia Salon, At first he mistaken me with another client with a black hair, and supposedly he told me himself that my hair won't turn out to be the way it is because my hair color is black. First of all.. I didn't even talk to this person at all. I saw him go in and out of the salon and that was it anyways, And My hair no black!! Long story short.  He told me to come in and they can fix my hair and he apologized with the situation because he realized that i wasn't that client that he supposedly talk too. When I came in, The hair stylist wasn't there  yet.. So i waited 15 mins. for her to get in. When she got it in... She has this Nasty attitude, like she didn't want to fix my hair. So i told her what I wanted and the color didn't show up. She still kept on insisting that it will fade over time. But no way im gonna wait a couple of weeks for my hair to fade and i paid 200+ to get my hair done! Get the hell out of here! Anyways, She finally started fixing my hair. She still had this nasty attitude towards me while she was fixing my hair but the hair was done and she fixed it. I love how the color turned out, it just like the picture that i showed her initially! I gave her another $20/tip .. mind you i gave her $20/tip the week before and i gave her another tip this visit.  I love how it turned out and i gave her my business card for work. I told her that I will call her in a few months to get a touch up. So that was for her to keep! Few days later... Sebastian started calling my work!! Like WTF!! It wasn't once.. it was about 5 times what my co workers told me at least. He said to call me back ASAP! What the hell... I gave the Hair stylist my business card for her to keep. So we can keep in touch for business... And sebastian starts calling my work like a maniac! None The less! The experienced with this Salon was supposed to turn around to a good review until Sebastian started to Call my work! How unprofessional! That is worst than a debt collector! NEVER AGAIN! Avoid this place! It is a bad attitude workers and unprofessional people and pricey at the same time!!

I thought I'd never find a cheap place in Vegas. But, oh my gawd, did I find one really!? Yayo Taco is the bomb! $1.75 to $2.25 tacos with a lot of tasty goodness overflowing in your mouth. If you happen to be in Vegas, be sure to visit this joint just to have a taste of why I'm so excited about it. It's near the strip, just take a cab ride. Come on, you can do it! You must try their Bombay Taco and Shanghai Taco. It's oh so good to the very last bite. (Don't bite your fingers! The sauce drips.) I also tried their Pastor Taco and Carne Asada Taco. They were on the spot delicious in everything! Who cares if the place looks like a dive bar?! It is a dive bar! The food tasted awesome and they have a whole page list of beers. Go international! Drink it with a great taco! This is my second flavortownusa-hop. I haven't been disappointed. I'll always pass by this place when in Vegas.

First off I'd like to start off with how AMAZING the food is. I can't complain about that. I honestly think they have the best menu in Vegas! It's my go-to spot for Sushi. They get 10 stars on the food! \n\nAs for the service, I don't know where to start. Don't get me wrong the servers are nice, never get an ugly attitude with them BUT they are so incompetent. Each and every single one of them. I'm not sure if they were trained that way but I get that experience with them every single time I come in. I feel like they forget to put my order and that's why they come by and ask what \""I'm waiting for..\"" It never fails! I am a server myself so I know how it can get sometimes... BUT it is so ridiculous that I get the same experience every time. I almost think that they're doing it to me on purpose, and I usually tip on 18-20% but this last time I just couldn't do it.  So the one star is for the service but the food is AAAAMAAZING!  \n\nIf you're willing to try delicious food on terrible service I'd suggest you try Oyshi.

This was my second visit to Brake Masters on [[Tropicana]] and it [[will]] [[be]] my [[last]]. I had purchased a card to get service and oil changes (3) for $35 from groupon for Brake Masters. On my first they changed the oil in my wife's [[Camry]] and gave me a [[long]] [[list]] of items they said [[needed]] [[attention]] one of them being that it needed a new air filter. I had just put one in 2000 miles before so I told them not today. \nWhen [[I]] got home I checked things out under the hood and they had left a bolt out of the filter housing and now it is lost.\nI thought oh well it was just an oversight and would try again with my Jeep. So I take it in and they do an oil change and filter and were supposed to [[lube]] it. They get it done in less than 30 minutes and I am on my way. I went to put the receipt away and notice on it that they used 5w-20 oil in it and so take it back. The manual says that grade of oil is only to be used if maximum temperature will be 60* . So the manager says [[ok]] we'll make it right and gets it on the rack they drain the oil and [[start]] to [[lower]] it down so I asked what about the filter it has 1/2 qt of wrong oil. So the guy asks the manager and he said ya go a head and change it again. So they change it and drain the new one and put it back in the box to be used on someone else's car also the oil they drained out they put in a clean pitcher and poured it back into the oil tank. Now all the oil is contaminated with the mixed oil from my jeep and the new oil.\nThen the manager tells me that the 5w20 is a better choice than the required 5w-30 that jeep recommends. This in my opinion is reason enough to not go back, until I climb und the jeep and find that they did not grease anything and also disconnected the breather for front differential at the pumpkin which if I was to go through any water would contaminate the oil.\nThe total lack of concern on what type of oil and lack of skill that they have at this business warrants not going there again. I hope this helps at least one other person. I you do go there please double check their work.

Happy Hourrrr! My favorite combination of words. \nThey serve happy hour everyday at the bar until 8 (sorry..can't remember what time it starts). Who doesn't love a place that offers happy hour daily?! Anddd with great food options? Can't beat that. \n\nSo, I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen for $8 and the Angry Tuna Roll. Both were packed with flavor and super tasty. I don't even like fish, but I was so intrigued by the description of the angry tuna roll that I decided to try it out. It did not disappoint me at all. The broth to the ramen had the perfect amount of seasoning and the noodles were cooked just right. \n\nThe ambiance was also really cute - would be perfect for date night. \n\nIf you're concerned about the overpriced regular menu - then you should at least give happy hour a shot!

I [[enjoyed]] the Arizona Ultimate Women's Expo.  It was something that of course was geared towards women, but I saw several men there as well.  I must have entered at least 15 drawings.  Deidre Hall was great.  It's an even better time if you can get a few girlfriends to go with you.  There were 4 different stations for alcohol samples.  Some of them were good some not so much, like the Senorita Limonita.  That was horrible.  If anyone plans on going in the future, plan ahead.  I totally didn't even think about the Diamondbacks playing.  I had to drive a little bit further for parking, which was [[worth]] it.  It only cost me $5, whereas every other lot or garage I saw, was $15 or $20.  Also, take your time when walking through the expo.  There's so much to see and do.  Find out when the keynote speakers go on and when demos are, so that you can get the most out of it.

A bookstore in a mall... genius!  WRONG not when you work there and your General Manager is a selfish idiot.   I have not been back since I left this [[horrible]] [[job]] but I do [[hope]] that things have straightened themselves out and that they fired that bitch Marcie.    I  mean what kind of company keeps a General Manger who walks out of her store seeing a line that has grown 20 people deep with the phones ringing off hook and not to mention the lack of staff on the sales floor to assist those growing impatient customers.  I can't even tell you how many times I had to take customer complaints about the lack of staff.   \n\nAs far as product they might say they have it but good [[luck]] at finding it.  These high school seniors and freshman college students they hire have far better things on their minds (themselves) and could care less where they have [[shelved]]  that book you are now looking for.   Now if it's a best seller you'll have no problem finding it since it will be displayed on tables and end-cap displays through out the store and depending on the season possibly displayed in a floor stack as well...after all they did receive 50 copies of the book to begin with and receive an additional 12 when 1 is sold. As for  CD's and DVD's since you are already at the mall I would recommend going somewhere else as they are far over priced at any Borders.\n\nThe only thing I would rave about is the magazine selection.  The Biltmore location will provide you with the widest variety but all locations have a ridiculous amount of titles.

The lines at Tacos El Gordo were too long so we decided to just eat at this Denny's. Bad choice. It was New Year's Day but the place was dead. Only one other table of customers besides us. A guy came to our table and took our drink and food order and never returned. We went 35 minutes with no drinks or acknowledgement. The manager had time to clean a window partition yet couldn't find the time to get us our drinks or even just acknowledge us. We were sat in the far corner so I couldn't see the kitchen but the manager seated us and the guy cooking took our order so they knew we were there. Finally I decided we would leave and go to a different location. I walked over to the kitchen to tell the manager we were leaving. She said \""oh wait I'll cook your food right now\"" and I told her to forget it. I mean they were only going to start cooking our food because I said we were leaving. She never once said sorry or showed any type of sympathy to the situation they put us in. She  had no issue with us leaving and could have cared less.

If eating food counted towards your gambling debt than this place should be considered part of your losses. In fact this place is a total loss, a \""bad beat\"". \n\nI had a beef stew over rice, which came out quickly but it wasn't anything special.

I just brought my 3 year old son here last week and what a treat it turned out to be. He loved it! The displays were so releastic, educational, and fun. I mean my son just turned 3 and is not quite reading and still came out of there with a lot of new knowledge. He is also really into dinasours, so the dinasour room thrilled him. He also really enjoyed all the live animals they had, shark, sting ray, fish, turtle, lots of bugs, snakes, bearded dragon, etc. He had a blast and I know as he gets older he is going to love it more and more. As an adult I also really enjoyed it and learned many new things.

My family [[wanted]] to eat a good and cheap Christmas dinner as we were going to hit the buffets the next day. Known for the prime rib and steak and egg specials, Victorian Cafe was our destination that cold Christmas night. We got there around 9:30 PM and although there were a few empty tables, we were seated about ten minutes after we got there. Something about having to wait for the waitress to seat us. \n\nAnyway, I scanned the Yelp reviews on what was good, and decided to go with their prime rib special, which is usually $12.99 but on that day, was raised to $13.99. Too bad the steak and egg special is valid only after 11 PM. Each prime rib special comes with a salad or soup and fries, mashed potatoes or a baked potato. And of course, the table gets a basket full of hot rolls and butter. \n\nThe salad and rolls were delicious, but we all wanted to save our appetites for the prime rib. (We all ordered the same thing, haha). The prime rib comes out a while later, which made us all think that ... man, they must have run out of prime rib, so they're cooking us some good fresh one! When it arrived, each one was pretty darn big. Mine was a little bigger than the size of my hand! Unfortunately, the prime rib tasted really weird. It didn't even taste like meat! I felt like I was chewing on some weird variation of prime rib (almost like a vegetarian prime rib). It tasted like an imitation, and not at all like how prime rib usually tastes. Needless to say, my family and I were all very disappointed. We had to force the prime rib down, and this was the first time we actually had food left on our plates that we did not take back in a to-go box. \n\nGood service, good salad and bread, but sucky prime rib! The crust was too salty and the meat was too rubber tasting. We were confused as the meat was pink - not overcooked, but just not tasting the way it should. The ambiance was nice with dim lighting and booth seating (tables as well), but that prime rib was a shame.

They have tonnes of space for people. It's fun for kids - the front lobby has a pond with fish and there are tanks throughout the restaurant that also have cool fish to look at. \nThe food is always so good I never want to leave.

NOTE: Our stay could have been an entirely different experience had we not booked a stay the weekend after a Livingsocial.com deal was made available.  We did not buy that deal, we were regular customers...\n\nOk, starting at the beginning.  \n\n- Check-in is 4:00pm.  We got there at 3:50pm, arrived to a line of no less than 30 people.  NO rooms were available for us.  They temporarily checked us in and said we could go to the water park and call back in an hour to see if a room was ready... but, the only place to change was at the Athletic Club clear on the opposite side of the park.  By the time we hiked over there and back it was 5pm.  Our room wasn't ready until 6:40 (we called about 5 times until they finally had one ready.)  \n\n- The room was [[HOT]].  It was on the top floor and really never cooled down, even after we removed a gross, dirty air filter (I'll be posting a picture in case you're into looking at icky stuff.)  If you're one of those people who likes it very quiet to sleep, top floor is bad.\n\n- Also, on the noise topic, our bathtub dripped so bad it sounded like the faucet was on a slow trickle the whole time.  Water wasters!  Side note, the bathroom was so small you had to step out of the way to shut the door.  A large person might need to step into the tub to shut the door. :(\n\n- Gross... there were several places of STICKY on the carpeting.  2 were right in places where normal people put their feet all the time so that was annoying and nobody should have been in that room until that was cleaned (but they were completely sold out because of the LivingSocial.com deal.)\n\n- The railings along the walkways to our room seem 'flimsy' to an acrophobe like me.  If you have small children, or rowdy older kids, you might ask for a room on a different floor.  A lower floor, closer to the ground... safer.\n\n- The Oasis water park was ok, but the staff had no continuity.  One person would allow a 47\"" child to ride the slide, another wouldn't.  One day they didn't care if your floats were by your seats while you ate lunch, the next day they were collecting them just for getting out of the water.  And so on and so forth...  And any time you get a bunch of people staying at a resort they wouldn't normally be able to afford, you're going to get a class of people that are... sub-par.  We saw at least 2 instances of people just taking other peoples chaises, even when they clearly had their personal stuff (shoes, shirts) stored there.  There was considerable pushing and shoving to get in the water, lots of unsupervised, rude 8-12 year old kids.  All of this was a nuisance that probably is not a regular issue.\n\n\n\nTHE HOTEL DID TRY TO MAKE RIGHT BY US.  We only complained about having to wait for a room for so long and they ended up cutting our hotel rate in half (which was then less than those LivingSocial.com folks) and giving us vouchers for drinks (6) and enough vouchers to cover our lunch (for 6 people.)  So they were aware of how screwed up things were.  We didn't complain about the room or the park as it was so incredibly busy it didn't seem worth it.

Easily the best pizza on the west coast and rivals the best from the east. environment is just really chill with the music playing, crowds of people, big screen tv's playing the Lakers game. they even got some old school pinball machines and an arcade game. its kind of a hard place to find if you know what to look for from all the clues that you get from anyone that's even been there but its worth it once you get there.

My experience here was a mixed bag.   We went in around 7:45 on a Friday evening without a reservation and were able to get seated before the bartender even had a chance to finish making my white grapefruit martini which was very refreshing.\n\nFor dinner, I opted to start with the spring salad minus the pig ear bacon.   This was [[FABULOUS]]!!!  I would have ordered a second one if it wasn't $10.  I followed this up with the Tagliatelle Pasta (tomatoes, garlic and squash, oh my) which could have been amazing but was only so-so because I was served the most undercooked pasta ever.   The flavors in the dish were awesome.  I wanted to lick the plate but it was hard to get past the chewy pappardelle noodles (not tagliatelle) which were 2 minutes short of al dente.   I did mention this to the waiter who passed along the info to the chef which I appreciated (witnessed it since the kitchen is so open).\n\nWe passed on a dessert which is a rarity because they just didn't have many options and the ones they did weren't up our alley.   I was craving cheesecake or some kind of fall dessert (maybe an apple turnover).\n\nNow here's the weird part.  When the bill came, there were only three items on the menu (my dinner wasn't listed).  I thought my pasta had been comped because it was so undercooked but then I realized the items in the bill totaled $16 less than the total bill  (ie something was in the total that wasn't in the itemized listing).  It just so happened to be my pasta.  When I pointed it out the waiter, he just said it was an error in the system.  Perhaps I'm reading into it, but I just thought it was shady that I was paying for it but it wasn't appearing on the bill.   I don't know; must be the accountant in me.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is pleasant and the service was so-so.  The waiter was a little inattentive given how few tables were filled.   Overall though, I was pretty pleased.   I really loved their use of flavors so I was more than willing to pay the higher-end prices but I was disappointed in my undercooked pasta.

[[Meh]]. I've experienced [[better]].\n\nGood and cheap Mexican food absolutely must [[be]] inclusive in order to work.  Here it's just barely.  Saying that, I still decided to go more than once.\n\nFirst go was on a weekend when they make [[Menudo]].  [[This]] is a dish that will usually either scare me from future visits or [[endear]] the place to me.  For the first time ever: all I could say about it was, \""[[meh]].\""  Apparently there is a variation of Menudo that's neither great nor horrible.  The [[tripe]] was tender and for the most [[part]] trimmed well.  The broth was definitely lacking some flavor, but not that a few additions didn't remedy it sufficiently.  My biggest issue was that probably a good third of my order was taken up by one of their stewing bones that just happened to get scooped in there.  It can [[happen]], but this one was too big to be entirely negligence.\n\nSecond go [[involved]] [[two]] tacos.  I like to pit a place's carnitas versus adobada to see which one I prefer of theirs.  For the record, their adobada won this battle.  Really, in my experience, I haven't seen many places with the skill to screw up either of these.  Both were quite tastey, but the portions I'm used to were slightly lacking.  I guess I've been spoiled by places that have made me wonder if there was a tortilla under there.  They didn't just skimp on the meat though, but also the toppings.  Just a smidge of pico de gallo and a dollop of guacamole that wouldn't take me too much convincing that they bought from a supermarket.  Still I will point out that both the carnitas and adobada were well prepared and full of the right flavors.\n\nA special note will go to their pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos.  It's pretty difficult for a condiment to catch my attention, and truth be told, I almost missed out.  On my first visit, someone, noticing my initial indecisiveness on the menu, deduced that I had never tried them and recommended them heartily.  The fact that they provide sandwich bags to be able to take some home means that it's no secret the stuff is good.  Cooked just to the right amount to have both some caramelization and crunch.  Spiced and pickled to be tangy without an overbearing heat.\n\nAn all latino and friendly staff -- which is a must in my book.  English isn't the best, and something tells me even a little Spanish will get you a tad better service.  Either way, it's all pretty decent.

Jennifer Pendleton (the event sales coordinator) and her team are truly the best! Jennifer definitely made the wedding planning process stress free and smooth sailing! I am so blessed to have hired her as a wedding planner and pulling off our special day. Everything was beautiful and flowed seamlessly. My guests NEVER wanted for anything during their stay.  We received so many compliments on our wedding and it was all because Jennifer and her team pulled everything together perfectly.  She knows what she is doing! If I had to rate my experience at the Mansions on Fifth from 1 to 10...it would be a 20! Whenever we needed something or had a question, Jennifer and her team were always responsive and quick!

No \""I'm so sorry\"" or \""I really apologize\"", NOTHING.\n\nAll in all not a great experience, but if you want a large quantity of food you can't beat it for 20 bucks

Considering what I read from all the reviews I [[thought]] I'd really enjoy Casa Rasta. \n\nOn my visit I ordered the Queso Fundidos with Green Chorizo which was supposed to be \""spicy\"" but it lacked spice and had no flavour definitely wasn't too impressed.\n\nBut I didn't let that stop me too much. I then went on to order the Jamaican Jerk Chicken, CItrus Marinated Pork, and the Roasted Pork Tacos. Still a little lack luster in flavour. I don't know when I think Mexican and I think Carribean cuisine i think loud bold flavours. Casa Rasta nice try but you're not doing it for me. \n\nMaybe I'll try Casa Rasta again but I don't think I'll be making a trip out to Beechview JUST to go to Casa Rasta.

I [[had]] a wonderful romantic weekend here at Camelback last weekend, and this place NEARLY has a 5 star rating in my opinion. The staff is incredible, the food is scrumptious (might I recommend that you eat at the bar and get sangria and enchiladas!?), the rooms are clean and very unique, and the parking was convenient and easy to carry in and out.  \n\nThe pool was nice, but not great. That's the missing star. No fountain to swim under, and not curved enough for little sanctuaries of privacy. I might be picky, but the Kierland is one of my [[favorite]] pools - and I have been to some classy pools in Tucson for a \""staycation\"" or two - and this was just average.\n\nAt the end of the day, it was [[miraculously]] cool (110 degree day) and we took a walk around and it was so pretty, and we sat outside and had a drink and enjoyed the patio outside the bar and the live music - such a nice vibe.  \n\nThe other reviews are all accurate - even the local fued and the crowded pool!  I must say that we did NOT use the spa last weekend, but I did use it last year for a day trip with some girlfriends and it's a HUGE 5 star spa.  The pool is GREAT!

I was, prior to visiting, a little disappointed that I never got a chance to visit D'Arcy McGee's before it was replaced by Bar Louie. After hearing from my employer and his brother-in-law that it was not such a great place, that disappointment faded.\n\nI decided to visit Bar Louie in early November while I was at Tempe Marketplace to watch a movie. I walked through the front door and was not greeted by either a hostess or any other employee. I traipsed toward the bar and was also not greeted by either of the two bartenders behind the bar. I continued forward and finally found a nice young lady whom I asked about seating. She retrieved a server and I requested to be sat on the patio. The patio was empty and I chose a corner table. My waiter informed me that he would be right back and would bring me a menu.\n\nAfter bringing a menu back, I inquired as to whether or not there were any beer specials ongoing. I was dismayed to find out that their refrigeration system was on the fritz and they only had three beers available: New Castle Brown Ale and two run-of-the-mill, piss-poor domestics. I chose the New Castle.\n\nAfter receiving my drink, I ordered from their very straightforward menu after asking the server what his personal favorite menu item was. The \""Four Tacos Plato\"" with blackened fish was selected, and off went the server.\n\nI received my food in a very timely manner and it was piping hot. Everything tasted fresh and it looked well-constructed.\n\nMy only complaint was the portion size. The tacos were listed under the \""Large Plate\"" section of the menu, but the tacos themselves were quite small. They were more reminiscent of street tacos as opposed to restaurant fare. Regardless, the service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable, the food was quite good and the atmosphere (at least from where I was sitting; on the outside looking in) seemed warm.\n\nAll-in-all, I can recommend it to others, but I can't say that it is a five-star establishment.

Any place with dueling pianos [[wins]] [[points]] with me.  I don't know that I would pick this place to eat but it makes for a [[great]] after dinner [[pub]].  The decor is your usual Irish Pub with a strong focus on dark wood and heavy furniture.  We were able to kind of steak out a little nook where we drank and talked amongst ourselves before meeting a few people seated near us.

For the second time this place made unauthorized charges on my credit card after i checked out.  this also happened last year when they accused me of taking a bottle of water from the mini bar and i was billed $40.  Other Las Vegas hotels don't do this!

I hate this place. We asked them if they would comp the drinks if we played the bar machines. They said you had to put at least $10 in, which is fair enough. I then tried to order Three Olives cake vodka with diet coke, and apparently they can only comp the garbage Smirnoff or Absolut. Are you kidding me?? They shoud be happy that anyone is even coming into this s**thole.

This place is horrible. I will never stay here again. The customer service is soooooo bad. I flew in from California and they gave my reservation away saying \""reservations are not guaranteed.\"" Elevators hardly work. They deactivated my room key everyday. Housekeeping knocks on your door everyday at 9am to remind them of checkout even if they are not checking out. Security got caught on camera taking a football game break IN my hotel room, not realizing someone had checked into it.The decor is very nice, but thats the only nice thing about this place. Their credit card swipes are so janky that it never works properly. Worst hotel experience Ive ever had.

A bit of a [[run]] down [[hotel]] in a location convenient to CMU. Everything is clean and functional, but really doesn't stray far from [[functional]].\n\nIt also has a few [[oddities]].

I'm not sure what all the hype is about. I ordered the poutine \""Elvis\"". It came with mushrooms, ground beef, green peppers and onions. The cheese curds were squeaky, a must for an authentic poutine. [[However]], what let me down was the fries and gravy. The fries weren't [[crispy]] and the gravy didn't have a beefy taste to it.

My boyfriend and I are huge fans of Oregano's, go at least twice a month, and have been to every one in the Valley and the one in Flagstaff.

And a pizookie!!\n\nYes, the wait is around 45 minutes every day of the week, but most of the time they will let you put in a deep dish pizza order while you are waiting.   Love it!

I do all the normal stops that Hawaii peeps do, which includes going to Trader Joes.\n\nI noticed a nail salon in the same strip mall and I wondered how much it would cost to re-do my gelish nails. I walked in and was pleasantly greeted by Elan.  I paid $40 which I would I have paid $45 in Hawaii. \n\nElan was able to do my nails without a wait time. I left it up to her to choose what she wanted to do with my nails. I did tell her that I did not want it too bling, just a little bling. \n\nI was totally impressed with her choice of color and bling; 15 days later my nails still look great (of course with a little growth). I did tell her that I wanted a fade so the nail growth would not be so obvious. \n\nI will definitely will be back there the next time I am in Las Vegas.

Glenha's serve up some good old fashioned grub on the Royal Mile. Bacon rolls, fry ups for breakfast and (a more unusual option) hot dogs are on the menu.\n\nIt's nicely decorated, the service is efficient and it's always thronging which proves how popular it is. It looks quite swish from the outside but the prices aren't through the roof, which makes it exceptionally affordable on the Royal Mile. \n\nWith filled rolls, baguettes and sweets, I've got to say my favourite snack from Glenha's has got to be one of their breakfast rolls. Fry up's are good old fashioned, simple food, and they always hit the spot.

I've eaten at the Ikea cafeteria several times, and while the [[food]] won't blow your mind, they have a good selection of hot buffet items (including the coveted Swedish meatballs with creamy gravy) as well as cold sandwich and salad plates. Another nice touch is that you can always find something with salmon in it. And although I'm not a sweet drink fan (I'm always searching for extra diet soda options), whenever I'm at the soda fountain here I help myself to an icy glass of lingonberry juice drink. Hey when in Sweden... er, Ikea, do as the other random shoppers do... or something to that effect.\n\nWhat I do want to mention that may be overlooked in other reviews of the Ikea cafeteria, is that they periodically have special dining events. I discovered on the Ikea website that they announce an all-you-can-eat Swedish Crayfish Party. Unfortunately, you cannot buy the tickets on-line, so you have to show up in person at the Ikea cafeteria. My delinquency in getting myself over there in the [[past]] stymied my chance at [[checking]] this event out years ago. This time I was determined to get my crack at some tasty mudbugs (having lived in Louisiana for seven years, I am a bit obsessed with getting my seasonal crawfish fix). I bought my tickets about a week in advance, and the second seating (6 - 8 p.m.) was already sold out. I settled on the first seating from 3 - 5 p.m. Note that this event takes place during a weekday, so not everybody has an accommodating work schedule for the early seating.\n\nThe Crayfish Buffet was quite impressive! The crawfish are served cold and aren't cayenne pepper spicy, like Cajun style. Rather, they have a distinctive dill seasoning that is interesting nonetheless. The rest of the buffet includes a mess of food including Swedish meatballs, pickeled herring, smoked salmon, salt-cured lox, cold salads, potatoes (boiled and mashed), cheese and crispbread, shrimp cocktail, and a great dessert selection of rhubarb tarts, elderflower cupcakes and cookies! You will not go home hungry after sampling everything.\n\nThe food service personnel were super friendly and helpful. The entire cafeteria area was closed to regular shoppers and reserved for the big party. The entire place was decked out with crayfish-themed decorations including bibs and party hats! We made new friends while waiting in line and dined and chatted the entire time. If you are a crawfish fan, or just an avid food explorer who wants to sample a little bit of Sweden, keep your eyes peeled for these occasional funky events at the Ikea cafeteria. What a blast!

I have to say, same great food as the other location, but slightly better service. \nWent with the Pulled Pork Sandwich again and it didn't disappoint. One small difference; They put the slaw on top of the sandwich!  Fries were very good as well. One day I will try some of their regular entrees instead of the sandwich. If you're craving BBQ Meat goodies, and are in the area, you won't be disappointed.

Wow. This place is excellent!\n\nI grew up in Charlotte and sadly, never discovered this place until after I moved away. I heard a couple of great recommendations, and my family decided to try it out. \n\nThe meal starts out with some outstanding cornbread, so buttery it seems light and almost melts in your mouth. We also got a fried green tomato appetizer, which was really good. Between the four of us we had 2 orders of salmon cakes (delish), fried chicken, and ribs, and probably one of each of the sides. I would definitely recommend the salmon cakes again, fried chicken and ribs are a bit heavy for me but my dad and brother went to town. Everything was really good and made me lament living so far away from good southern cookin'.\n\nThen there was dessert. While my mom, brother and I were unbuttoning the top button of our pants and trying to make a little bit more room, my dad was going strong. We ended up with a slice of sweet potato cake (divine!) and a slice of coconut cake to take home for later. The waitress told us that all of the cakes are made by a woman in her home, and we could just imagine what her house must smell like... \n\nOur server was super friendly and comfortable; she was really nice but not in the kind of way where she was trying too hard. \n\nLove love loved it. I will look forward to coming back on each visit home!

[[I]] can't seem to fathom what the employees are [[thinking]] at this place. They [[show]] no [[hospitality]] at all, and basic restaurant service seems to be non-existent. They work as if they're [[offended]] to be our waiters and waitresses.\n\nAs my party and I are seated, the server asks us if we are ready to order.  We need some time to look at the menu, so we tell him to give us some time.  Only thirty [[seconds]] pass when he returns and [[asks]] us to order.  We repeat the procedure about 2 more [[times]] until we feel so compelled to order we give in.  My dad had a [[special]] request to [[add]] [[chicken]] and beef in the soup, but the server couldn't understand us. He seemed [[really]] [[confused]] and frustrated, so he brought someone else over who had better English.

[[Plus]] the server's [[attitude]] earlier [[set]] me off from my usual happy piggy mood.\n\nWe asked for extra dishes and the server seemed offended that we were giving orders.  Maybe I'm just reading into their body language too much, but they give the expression like I said something mean about their mother, which of course wasn't the case. Seriously, what's the deal? Not once did they stop by to check up on our water, or ask if things were okay.\n\nThe food itself is OK, but that day it tasted especially bland. Maybe the bad service was getting to me.  I noticed the pho tasted like noodles and water; no amount of hot sauce or fish sauce could add any flavoring.  Judging by how fast the food was served, I wouldn't be surprised if it was just composed of water. We rose and paid for our meal, and I felt like I wasted every cent of it.  I would've had better service at McDonalds, hands down.  My whole afternoon would've been ruined but thankfully the Yogurtland right next door cheered us up.  As soon as we enter, we are greeted with a warming hello.  That alone made me feel better.

I must say, the staff and atmosphere made me feel much more comfortable than my earlier journeys that evening. I wouldn't call myself a beer enthusiast, but after our server brought us a flight of various samples, I was hooked! The atmosphere was GREAT, live music and a friendly crowd.

I hate writing bad reviews but this seriously warrants it.  Maybe other Lowes are better but this particular store just fails.  Management hides behind their employees and don't own up to their mistakes of which with my delivery there were multiple.  They forgot our delivery and while I waited all day no one from Lowes call about it.  Then after I called, they said they forgot to load my units on the truck and they rescheduled my delivery.  When they did show up the units they were going to deliver were damaged and undeliverable.  They delivery guys said they'd get us new units that day or the next.  After waiting 24 hrs for a call from Lowes, I called and was told it won't be in till Wednesday.  Well I wasted another day waiting around for a delivery that didn't come.  Absolutely no management took responsibility for the mistakes, it was all 'this wasn't my mistake' or 'I'm just finding out about this'. Absolutely no one was going to call me it seems instead they were find just taking my money. I know its a hardware store but seriously when someone gives you money principle dictates you give them their purchase.

I had a special salad of local heirloom tomatoes with a soft cheese (forgot the name), small leaves of basil and sea salt. Some of the best tomatoes I've had in years.

Craft cocktails are always a welcome treat. Craft cocktails served by a cool waitress/bartender are even better. Craft cocktails served by a cool waitress/bartender while listening to awesome music is the best. Philemon is a [[lot]] of [[fun]]. I can see how/if the place was packed that it might not be fun but most places, when packed, are not a lot of fun. Lucky for me and my friends, we came on a quiet Sunday night and enjoyed all the space and (relative) quiet that we liked. Well, if you count listening to dance and new wave as quiet. I do and it's [[fantastic]]!\n\nKnowing that PB was known for its libations, I started with a #7. The drinks are numbered and grouped by spirit. I'm all for drinks with a sweeter tinge to them (and not to say that this drink was like drinking a soda) but the experience was a bit beige for me. That's when [[Naomi]], our waitress/bartender, swooped in to action and told me that I should have ordered an Old Fashioned. I let her know that I'm from Kentucky and was Old Fashioned/bourboned out. She scoffed and said I'd never tasted one of hers. Intrigued, I ordered one and, true enough, I loved her take on an Old Fashioned. I don't know whether it was the bourbon, the bitters, the fruit, or the simple syrup/sugar, but the drink was as good as I've had and not at all humdrum. Vindicated, she told me that I should always trust her. I became a believer that evening. Trust in the cocktail powers (and infectious awesomeness) of Naomi. Now you know.

I just finished my first visit which was excellent.   Everyone was very friendly and they managed to squeeze me in for a cleaning on the same day I came in for a filling.  Dr. Larry was excellent as were all of the hygienists.  I'll definitely be sticking with the team at Shady Side Dental as long as I live in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe office is slightly unconventional -but in a good way: there are two friendly dogs who roam around named Tennessee and Sheba, and instead of individual rooms there are three patient bays set up more like cubicles.  It still feels private enough but it's something I've never seen before.\n\nAll in all, I recommend them highly!

!Hola meego! That's the enthusiastically friendly greeting everybody gets at this fun little Mexican restaurant. The decor matches the enthusiasm of the staff well: bright colors (even for a Mexican restaurant) are everywhere and everything intangible about this place is bouncing off the walls cheery. I guess its not a coincidence its called \""The Party\"".\n\nThey have a pretty extensive menu of all the expected classic dishes, plus many that you might not expect. I ordered the \""Ceviche Mexicano\"" with chopped (cooked) Tilapia and shrimp in a very lively light lime sauce over tostadas with lettuce, tomatoes, avocados, onions and other good stuff like beans, rice cheese, etc. I liked it a lot. The lady had very good Burritos Suizos, which were far too big to finish. Prices were $10 or less per entree. Good fried tortilla chips with salsa were gratis.\n\nThe highlight of the meal were the (Friday night special) 27 ounce Margaritas for $5.95 each. Dont bother with the math. This is by far the best Margarita deal I have ever come across in this town or any other en los Estados Unidos. No, I didn't drive home.\n\nI can't review this place without one more mention of the fact that everybody working here is just so damn nice. As our meal was winding down, no fewer than 5 staff members asked us how everything was. Any server/busser coming within 3 tables of us checked our table to see if we needed anything, every single time.\n\nLa Fiesta is not fine dining. However, it is a superlative casual dining Mexican restaurant and delivers incredible value and I can't wait to go back.

LOVED Montreal and LOVE, LOVE, LOVED Bixi.  It is not the primary reason why I visited, but it is the primary reason why I will visit again.  What a great way to enjoy an already lovely city!\n\nI am a huge fan of the concept, and I have used similar bike systems in other cities, but Montreal's Bixi is the first I have seen that has done such a thorough job of laying out their system; there are an adequate number of stations and they are logically located near bike paths so that you can find them in a timely manner to avoid overage charges.  I wish every city that installed a bike system would be so logical (u-u-uhhh-um, yes, I'm talking about you, Chicago).\n\nFurthermore, it's not just the Bixi bike system itself, it is the commitment Montreal has made to being a bikeable city that makes the whole thing work.  The city has obviously made a real investment in their bike-lane infrastructure and it has created a local bike culture that goes well beyond just the excellent Bixi system.   Kudos to you Montreal.  I hope the rest of the world is taking notes!

My friend n I have been wanting to come here for a very long time but sadly we were extremely disappointed. \n\nDecor: Tables are ugly. Decor on general isn't cohesive.\nDrinks: Worst bloody mary I've ever had.\nBrunch: Split the eggs Oscar. Asparagus was cold and the hollandaise was a little on the thick side.\nService: Our server Kristopher was not in a good mood and frankly turned us off from the very beginning. He might want to try smiling... Just saying \n\nSadly not impressed, maybe we'll just come back for beers.

My mouth is watering just thinking of the Capital Grille in Charlotte. I don't get to come here that often considering the price tag, but when I do, it's always nothing short of super fantastic. This particular Capital Grille is very classy from the service to decor to the selections of food and wine. The staff is very attentive, professional and informative. The food is insanely delicious and could feed you for days on end! \n\nCapital Grille, hands down, receives my Best Cheesecake in Charlotte award! I usually describe their cheesecake as this: \""It's a NY cheesecake, with a cookie dough-like crust instead of a graham cracker crust, and with a creme-brulee sugar-flambeed topping.\"" It's freakin' unbelievable! I would get just that cheesecake to-go on a random night if I ever wanted to! \n\nBut I digress... They also have a nice patio on the sidewalk of Tryon and 5th St. if you fancy people-watching while you enjoy a 4 course meal. They've also just added a lunch bites menu that is for those who need to eat and run at a much smaller price than their usual dinner fare.\n\nCapital Grille is just the place to go if you're looking to impress business clients, for a classy date night or for a special occasion with family or friends. Make a reservation and be prepared to eat/drink like royalty and drop money like you're makin' it rain!

This place... [[meh]], there are better places in town. Here's the deal: I walked in and told the guy behind the desk what I wanted done: [[preventive]] maintenance, tire rotation and oil change. He seemed confused that I'd found the place myself. \""Normally, we get referrals from the tire place next door,\"" he said. Okayyy.... uh, that's cool, I guess? [[Then]] he [[asked]] how I'd found them. \""Internet searches, Yelp,\"" I said. He seemed confused as to what Yelp is. [[Baffling]].\n\nThey did get my car done in the time they had promised and they essentially gave me a free diagnostic, which was nice. Oil change and tire rotation came out to $55, basically the standard retail price. \n\nHere's where it gets [[stupid]]: they wanted to [[charge]] me $90/hour for labor and triple mark-up on the parts in order to replace the [[serpentine]] belt and water pump. I know that mechanics mark up parts, but triple is ridiculous. I called around and ended up getting a quote from Gino's in Plaza Midwood for 30% less. Still a slight mark-up, but pretty much right down the middle, with reasonable labor costs. So, I'm going to Gino's instead.\n\nPeace out, Select Import. For your next customer, learn about this thing called Yelp and competitive pricing on parts and service.

Holy cow.  \nI could be a Hindu if only the method of worshipping was eating the object of worship.\n(which I guess makes my true natural religion Vulvan, but that's another story)   `,8^ }\n\nThe Half Priced, Half Kobe, Half Chuck, Happy Hour Daily Dose Burger was Wholly delicious.   The pretzel-bread bun just took it over the top.\n\nThe rest of the menu looked thoughtfully prepared, and a brief conversation with one of the principals confirmed the serious attitude with which they take their establishment.\n\nThe staff handling our patio party was to be heartily commended.  The server was actually remembering and calling most everyone at the table by their first name!\nThe empty plates and beer bottles never lingered long, and the cucumber slice infused (i'll never enjoy lemon-water quite as much again, this stuff was so refreshing!) water glasses were never empty.\n\nPerhaps the wonderful company of multiple yelpers and the genuine conversation had me in a bit of an in-clover stupor, but I left Daily Dose with a feeling of fulfillment that went far beyond my belly.\n\nSpecial thanks Donald for the set-up, and Carin's parents for being so hip and cool!

Went here because of watching it on food network and wanted to try the spaghetti pie. My stepdad and I went when there were very few customers. We were greeted by a very annoyed looking waitress, and when my stepdad asked for a table closer to the tv( no one in the place) she rolled her eyes and did. To make matters worse, we could smell the bathroom. (We weren't even close to it.) I couldn't find the spaghetti pie so I ordered the Mediterranean meal and my stepdad ordered the lasagna. The food was great but could not make up for the rude service and terrible experience. Ever since then, I have hated the place.

wow! What a surprise this resto was for me. I have been to the Outback on Sunset and Green Valley and do not remember it to be anything like this one on So.Las Vegas Blvd.\nI had the burger topped with their 'bloomin onions' and fries as a side dish.\nMy friend had the ribeye and baked potato and a side salad.\nOur food came at a reasonable time.\nI noticed that both our dishes were inordinately shiny (translate to - greasy!) but I didnt think much of it. I didnt finish my burger (ate about a 3rd of it and boxed the rest) finished my fries and my friend polished off her plate.\nThen we had coffee and key lime pie.\nAfter dinner, we headed out to the mall to \""walk off\"" all that grease we had consumed.\nBut as soon as I left the restaurant, I felt my mouth dry up. Thirty minutes after shopping, my friend wanted to go get a long cold drink of soda and so did I.\nWe were both so very very thirsty.\nAfter much thought, we were thinking about what could have possibly triggered such voracious thirst in both of us.\nSodium.\nThat restaurant served our food laced with maximum doses of sodium. \nI realized, my body reacts to MSG, and that what happens to me - I get very thirsty and  a bit swollen. Sure enough~! \nI will never eat there again - ever! \nDont bring your kids there although I saw very many families with young ones gobbling up the food.\nThey put too much sodium, cook with way too much grease.\nSodium is used as a preservative. I hoped I wasnt eating week old ground meat. Or worse(!) below standard quality ground beef.\nAll I can tell you is that, the following day - I got the runs,\nEat at your own risk!

Having eaten my way through most of the AYCE sushi places in Vegas, I can say that some definitely shine bright (more creative rolls, better fish selection, etc), but Sushi-mon wins every time in overall value, consistency and freshness.\n\nAdmittedly, I have history here, so this review may be somewhat biased. I've been coming here since the advent of AYCE sushi in this town. Though I've ventured off to try other places, I somehow always find myself back here. It sort of has a \""Cheersish\"" vibe for me.\n\nThe main reason I love it here is that I know I will get fresh, consistent product. I have never received anything less than that. At a lot of places in town, you may receive old or frozen fish which is very disconcerting. Sushi-mon somehow always has beautifully fresh fish. \n\nIn addition, they are FAST! I order something (in most cases, LOTS of things) and it's on the table in 5 minutes. Sushi-mon chefs seem to get a kick out of the people who order ridiculous amounts of food, so they send it out as quick as they can. \n\nSpeaking of the staff, they are as friendly as can be. Fransisco is my \""go-to\"" server and he always takes care of us. Paul, the busser/runner, knows us well too and always keeps our drinks filled and our table clean. \n\nBut on to the food...\n\nAs I said, we usually order our fair share of nigiri: hamachi, garlic tuna, aji, hirame, hotate with yuzu...but our favorites are the hokkigai (surf clam) and sake (salmon). I've never had surf clam as fresh and delicious as theirs. If you've tried surf clam somewhere else and hated it, try it here. Trust me.\n\nThe rolls are no joke as well. Some favorites are the Yebisu, Stacey and Hurricane roll, but I've yet to try one I didn't like. Another tip: you can get most rolls in \""hand roll\"" form. I like to get yumyum scallops, california and spider rolls that way. Also, try some baked green mussels. They're creamy and briny, yet sweet and unctuous. If you're still hungry after all that, get the Frying Jason roll. It's delicious, but it'll put you over the edge. Their side dishes (miso soup, tempura shrimp, sesame chicken, calamari) are terrific as well. \n\nOk. That's enough. This review is making me hungry. I'll see y'all there!\n:::insert Cheers theme song here:::

Solid dry cleaners.  I started taking my clothes to this place because they don't use toxic solvents, so it's better for the environment.  Plus, there's usually a 20% coupon in the local 891-- coupon book that comes in the mail.  \n\nAlbeit, it's a couple more dollars than my old cleaners but I think well worth it.  They do a great job; my clothes always come back nice and spiffy.  And best of all, I don't get that weird smell my clothes sometimes had after I took them to the regular cleaners.

Other then that the girls were very energetic, seemed very into the dances and kept great eye contact. The only down side is yes the chairs are so uncomfortable!! I got a seat at the end of the row so it wasn't too bad but my bf said he was soo uncomfortable it was starting to hurt towards the end. Once we got there a really old guy with all white hair asked my bf if we wanted \""VIP\"" seating or something and he tipped him a few bucks and got right in front :) one thing kinda sucked I had seen reviews that said the picture afterwards was $10 I absolutely wanted it and got it except it came out to $35!!

This show was awesome! Complete with cool stunts, music, emotion and a great story. \n\nThe most impressive part though is the inanimate star of the show, the incredible stage. It raises, lowers and pivots eleventy billion different directions and is quite the engineering feat. \n\nThe show does a great job of making you feel as though you are in the different environments throughout the story, and the speakers in the headrest of the seat add a great, personal surround sound effect when they are used. \n\nLove still remains my favorite Cirque show, and Vegas show in general, but this show was very, very good.

After a few bites i realized what I ordered isn't what I got.  So I handed it off to the manager looking dude and told him I'd prefer to get what I actually ordered.  His response was to bring it back to my table and try to convince me that what I had was what i actually ordered.  \n\nBye bye, Chandler Rumbi, I won't be back.

We were really skeptical about going here for breakfast while on vacation.  The reviews on here were horrible and there was a long line.  After looking around for a better choice, we decided that this was the best option available.  \n\nI am thrilled that we decided to do so.  The line moved very quickly and we got terrific service!  Our server was very personable and friendly without being annoying.  I ordered a Belgian Waffle, which wasn't very expensive and it was delicious.  The prices were a little high, but considering this is Vegas, not out of line.\n\nDon't be scared off by all of the bad reviews on here.  This place is terrific.

So I went on Priceline which btw is another serious issue because when you buy package deals from them; they don't let you pick the time or day you want to come in. Anyways back to the crappy hotel that is the Excalibur. It wasn't just the fact it was cheap looking and smelled like your Grandmas house that has 20 cats and smoke a pack a day; it was the customer service, the lack of housekeeping and the overly priced rooms that are not worth your money. My sister and I stayed for four days and not once did our room get cleaned. My sister left a mark on the sheets to see if they would be switched the next day and sure enough they were never switched. On top of that the lights went out and they wanted to charge me $130 to extend my check out for 2 hours. The customer service is horrific, especially for a Vegas hotel. I get the hotel is old and everything but come on people, have some pride. My sister lost her phone and asked customer service and the lady was SO RUDE to her and just said \""im sorry but I didn't see a phone\"", without even looking. So my sister goes to the manager and complains about the rudeness and also about her phone Sure enough the phone was in lost and found!\n\nPeople even if your looking for a cheap reasonable hotel...don't even waste your money. Stay at the Luxor which is nicer and reasonable and actually give a shit about their guests!

Found ourselves at Bachi after a long weekend, hungry for food that wasn't fast food,  yet not lemme-just-stuff-myself-silly buffet style either. Overall: love the concepts and menu but with a couple hangups!\n\nFOOD: downright delicious. Not gonna lie, I was pretty impressed. We ordered the truffle fries ($5.5) (medium cut, parm cheese, truffle gravy drizzle + sun-dried tomato aioli)...what in the holy hayellllll. This was so amazing! I could eat this literally as a side to every meal. The truffle wasn't overwhelming and I love the substitute of the aioli for like, Heintz ketchup or something. Very classy, Bachi. The Kiki burger ($11) was #1) cutely named and #2) cooked to perfection with the best flavor combo ever! I loved the bun, as it was somewhat sweet and pillowy. It had a mix of mushrooms, a bacon/sweet onion glaze and gruyere cheese. \n\nSERVICE: Not that great. It took a long time to get our food (30+ minutes). We were only 4 girls and didn't order anything out of the ordinary or massive amounts of food. Heck, the restaurant wasn't even that busy .. not all the tables were full, so I'm still a bit stumped why it took so long.\n\nDRINKS: The lychee boba milk tea was aiiiiight. Nothing special. They didn't put enough ice, so it was a bit warm and milky.. not really what I hoped for in 100+ degree weather. The lychee flavor was good though and not overwhelming.\n\nOVERALL: Satisfied, good for a try, not sure if I would go out of my way for this again, but if you do, it'll be a good choice!

[[Awesome]] [[little]] [[mom]] and [[pop]] [[type]] place been here about 3 times already. First [[time]] I did the all-you-can-eat dogs for 8.99. Ate about 6 hot dogs, some onion rings, and a Dr. Pepper.  There is a HUGE range of toppings you can put on your dogs offered at the buffet which include: [[pickles]], jalapenos, sliced or [[diced]] onions, [[nacho]] cheese, chili, tomatoes, [[relish]], chicago [[relish]], real [[crumbled]] bacon, deli mustard, regular mustard, [[ketchup]] (purists [[aside]]), etc. etc. the list goes on. Pretty much anything you can dream of! I also came in during a transition period between breakfast and lunch and one of the staff said to have at it with the breakfast buffet if I wanted. Awesome [[bonus]]! Grabbed some biscuits and poured some country [[gravy]] over those bad boys before diggin' into my dogs.\n\nSecond time around I [[brought]] my [[roommate]] and we had the all-you-can-eat buffet crab legs and prime rib for 18.99 (friday and saturday only). Felt bad about using the $10 for 20 [[yelp]] deal because I really like to [[support]] local businesses. Prime rib was pretty good, it was actually like really thin cuts of beef almost like roast beef don't be expecting a huge slab of meat and you'll be ok. It was pretty tasty, had about 4 plates of that.  The snow crab/king crab leg mix was extremely sweet, and fresh. Very high quality.  There was a bit of a wait time in between batches when the crab ran out, but it was worth the wait.  My roommate really liked the food, and the staff even made a special request of sunnyside up eggs to go with his prime rib. +++\n\nThird time did the hot dogs and sandwiches for 10.99. The Pizza STEAK is amazing! I think I can probably eat about 12 of those it's so good I can't describe it. Or maybe because my vocabulary is limited. Regardless its delicious go out and get one! Also had the cordon bleu sandwich which was pretty good, but I think i'll stick with the steak sandwiches.  Also had about 2 jalapeno dogs and loaded them up with toppings. \n\nMan I'm kind of drooling just thinking about it. I just went yesterday and I'm tempted to go again but I'll save some money. Love this place and I love to support local mom and pop joints. No other places offer hotdog/sandwich buffets in the area so this place is a gem.  If you are on the fence about trying it, I say give it a go. Definitely one of my new go-to places!

Checked in and was happy that I was given 2 free buffets with my stay.  I used the free buffet for my wife and I, but I of course had to pay for my 2 kids.  Good thing my wife and I were free cause the buffet was an epic fail.  I also played a few hands with blackjack, and the dealers have zero [[personality]].  I liked the fact that the room started off at $39 for a special I got early, but to add $20 resort fee to each night sucked.  I could of stayed elsewhere for $59 instead, with no resort fee.  Overall, I would say it is an okay stay, but I think I'll look elsewhere next time around.

\""[[No]].\""  \n\nIf you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say. \n\n0 stars for the single kinda [[scattered]] and [[scruffy]] staffperson.  \n\n0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it.\n\nIn this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe.  The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.  \n\nThe limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant.\n\nOn entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat [[harried]] [[staff]] person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.  \n\nThere are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED!\n\nWhen I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of \""I am the only staffperson here...\""  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isn't filthy, but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception. \n\n6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again.\n\nStaffperson's attention was no longer on me.  The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.  \n\n6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.  \n\n6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.  \n\n6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated \""This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish\"".  I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation.\n\n6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have \""The Best Curry in the Valley\"",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.  Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson, I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business.

The room was pretty nice, BUT on the day we checked out our friend was removing luggage from the top of the TV Cabinet (pretty tall at least 6 ft) and a DUSTY, OLD, USED CONDOM [[FELL]] TO THE [[GROUND]]. Idk about you guys, but I was pretty [[pissed]] that our [[room]] ended up not being cleaned from top to bottom especially with it being Caeser's Palace. \n\nMy boyfriend called the front desk and explained the situation and they said they'd send up a manager. We got a call about 10min later from front desk saying they'd comp a phone call that was made for $62 (boyfriend had called me \""long distance\"" because it was a call from NV to a CA cellphone - was about 5 minutes long). Obviously that wasn't the point and they ended up sending up the manager. So the manager and another random lady showed up, we explained the story and he pretty much confirmed what had happened. To be honest, I don't think anybody believed us because we all LOOK like we're teenagers but I was the youngest in the room and I am 23, so they probably thought we made everything up.\n\nANYWAYS, 10 min passed and we got another phone call from some random person who was obviously given the task to call us and he said they'd comp us $50 for the room. Our other roommate then chimed in explaining how what had happened was a completely violation to cleaning standards, but nothing else happened. On the way down I reminded them that they said they would comp the WHOLE phone call and not just $50, so when we went to the Check-Out desk we explained to the lady our story and she was happy to do it (of course she was, so we wouldn't cause a commotion most likely). We all remained professional during the entire thing and kept telling them it wasn't about the money, it was just disgusting and they acted like it wasn't a big deal.\n\nAnyways, probably never staying here again. Completely grossed out and disappointed with the lack of customer service with this place. Caesar's Palace is going to SH*T.

While we were waiting for our crepes I had a sudden craving for french onion soup. My bf noticed the boulangerie and went inside to see if they had some. He came back with a cup of soup. I opened the lid and did not see any gruyere (the melted cheese floats on top of the soup). I was like wtf! Bf went back inside to ask if the soup normally comes with the cheese and they said no. I was like damn! The cheese is like the best [[part]] of this soup! The base was alright...but come on...I need the cheese to make it complete!

I expected this location to be similar to the one in PHX: underwhelming and overpriced. However!!! I experienced something much better.  It just seems a bit more quant..put together..and a place that encourages interaction between  guests and invites you to truly enjoy yourself.Maybe its just the new place...the layout (additional bar outside) or the low key yet swanky atmosphere....\nI'm not totally sure.

So I've ordered from this Cugino's location about 5 times now and here are my thoughts.  In regards to their customer service, they have been great every time.  I call and order, they tell me when the order will be ready, and when I get there it is.  That may sound simplistic, but it's kinda nice that every time I've called, they've kept their time frame honest and accurate.\nThe pizza is great.  It's different than the Maryland location because they use a brick oven as opposed to a traditional pizza oven, but the results are very good. The crust/cheese/sauce is just right and absolutely a true NY style slice.  The garlic knots are the standard boring variety that most places in town sell.  I've yet to order anything else off of the menu, but for the pizza, I would highly recommend this place.

Decor is great, service spot on, and the steaks are primo.

Yet again severely disappointed in how US Airways handles their business. Poorly operated, poor customer service representatives, and over-all lack of commitment to the patrons that frequent their business. Yet more delays without a good reason behind them and with no plan in place to resolve said delays. I would recommend paying a higher price for flights with their competitors as at least Delta, Southwest, and United are much easier to work with.

cheap, good food.\n\nI'm partial to the pterodactyl w/everything and the fried pickles (and maybe some crab pups), but Pinky's never lets me down when I graze to other parts of the menu. I've never ordered something new and been disappointed, so that wins points in my book.  My only problem is that every time I want to try the taco special they're already out of it, but then again I don't always eat my meals at a respectable hour. \n\nService is usually great- but sometimes just good, mixed drinks have never seemed weak, and you can't complain about the music or the nightly specials. I can take my parents there when they're in town or I can have a less respectable evening throwing back a few with friends, but best of all I could close my eyes and point to anything on the menu and be pretty satisfied with whatever it was, and the price attached to it.

Four adults and two children today for lunch.  Have nothing to complain about, as service was great and our food just about perfect for what we ordered.  Kids meals of corn dogs, and macaroni & cheese.  YUM!  Two chicken pot pies (one had the chicken a little too well done which left it sort of tough), the other one, perfect.  I had a cup of French Onion Soup and an artichoke.  Seems I can't get past their grilled artichokes whenever we eat here.  Delicious!  In fact that is one of the main reasons I love to eat here.  As stated before, service was very good with everyone being so attentive and we will definitely be back!

This has to be one of my top 5 favorite clubs in Vegas!  The DJ was playing all genres of music and was mixing up the beats well. We walked in the club on a guest list and the wait wasn't too long. All the VIP Host and security were polite and helpful.  After a few drinks at the bar we decide that we wanted to do bottle service and the host team was able to accommodate us pretty fast which was cool. Going forward we will definitely be doing  bottle service when we come here.

I've been to [[Sushi]] [[Kame]] [[lots]] of times, and it's always a great [[experience]].  I would [[definitely]] say it's my [[favorite]] [[sushi]] [[place]] in the area. \[[n]]\nThey [[start]] you out with a [[free]] cucumber and somen [[noodle]] salad.  It's [[small]], but [[very]] [[appetizing]].  [[I]] [[still]] can't figure out [[exactly]] what the [[dressing]] is, but [[I]] [[always]] [[drink]] the [[extra]].  After that they give you a (also [[free]]) [[miso]] [[soup]], which is pretty good as [[far]] as [[miso]] [[soup]] [[goes]].    [[Oh]], and the [[green]] [[tea]] is [[free]] and they use [[real]] matcha as far as [[I]] can tell.  It's got a [[really]] nice, [[light]], [[floral]] [[taste]].\[[n]]\nI've also been to Yellowfin a few [[times]].  [[While]] Yellowfin is good, the [[reason]] that [[I]] [[like]] Sushi [[Kame]] more is [[probably]] their \""[[American]] [[Sushi]]\"" combo.  [[For]] about $14, you get [[three]] pieces of salmon nigiri, [[three]] tuna nigiri, a salmon roll, and the [[house]] salad, which is lettuce with ginger dressing.  The slabs of fish on the nigiri are [[nicely]] [[cut]] and usually pretty thick, giving the sushi a rice-to-fish ratio that definitely favors the fish.   Speaking of the fish, it has always been fresh and clean-tasting, never \""fishy.\""  Admittedly, I've only had non-midwest sushi once, so my basis for comparison is only other sushi in Illinois.  \n\nWhen it comes to maki, I usually stick with the simpler stuff that lets you taste the fish more, so I can't offer much of an opinion on the super tempura fried california rolls or whatever.  The unagi rolls are good though.\n\nI've had the sea urchin here as well, and while it's softer than the stuff at Yellowfin, there's also more of it and it tastes really, really good.

Update:  We went back to MGM after their renovation.  This time we stayed in the West Wing.\n\nAfter our amazing experience the first time, my wife and I were less than impressed with the West Wing rooms.  They're pretty small and far away.  Definitely the \""low rent district\"" rooms.  Our room had a broken lamp, stains on the carpet, and stains (maybe paint?) on the comforter and sheets.\n\nWe'll might stay here again because the service is great.

They're tasty, generally sweet items for people who prefer their poison colourful. The full list of available mixed drinks is quite exhaustive and you can expect to find something right for you. The beer, on the other hand, is somewhat disappointing, with a limited selection of somewhat overpriced brands on tap. Still, with such a solid offering, your friends will soon find it in themselves to belt out their best Sinatra.\n\nFor a great variety at the expense of decent cheap beer, Zo\u00e9 receives four Bohemian Rhapsodies.\n\nExtras:\n\nThis is where this place really shines. \n\nLet's agree that Karaoke is a gimmick to sell alcohol to groups who normally would not be inclined to close a bar, let even go to one. Zo\u00e9 recognized this and ran with it. They will gimmick the crap out of you.\n\nBefore the Karaoke starts, the bar doubles as a specialized fondue restaurant (!), and demonstrates a staggering dedication to the concept. The white tablecloths, the reusable towelettes, the wine card, the actually pretty great food and all the details I missed; it's like they're secretly ashamed of being a Karaoke bar. This makes for a mighty fine evening.\n\nThere are some other inspired decisions. The songbooks are actually computers with keyboard screwed into the walls; you can look up songs by title or artist name almost immediately, provided you know what you are looking for. Singers have their back to a giant screen where onlookers can easily read the lyrics and sing along. There is a smallish dance floor. The gambling room is entirely isolated from the main bar. The restrooms are way classier than they have any reason to be.\n\nFor outdoing themselves in any conceivable respect, Zo\u00e9 gets five Awesomes out of a possible five.\n\nAs with any Karaoke bar, your night will largely by defined by the people with you. That being said, once you are ready to surprise your coworkers with that one song you sing really well, you'd be hard pressed to find a better stage than Zo\u00e9's. It's relentless assault of genuine coolness on what is essentially a kitschy activity will win the hearts of even the most stuck-up anti-singing drones. Five stars.

Sugar Factory, I had such high hopes for you! And you let me down... and I'm a sugar addict!\n\nDon't get me wrong, like others have stated SF has wonderful desserts.  There are a variety of baked goods, candies, ice creams, and other sugary goodness, but the food in the cafe was OK at best.\n\nWe ordered the macaroni and cheese pops (the only tasty item I had all night besides dessert). They were amazing! The sauce is off the chain! (Do people even say that anymore?) Definitely order these. You will NOT be disappointed. \n\nI also started off with a Lollipop Passion Goblet cocktail. It was overpriced and full of ice (and dried ice)! It was $36 and I didn't even get a buzz (weak)! They have a variety of different goblets available, with a hefty price tag and no pay off, I was reluctant to order another cocktail.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the French Dip which was tasteless and bland. Pretty much the worst French Dip I've ever had. My best friend had their sliders, which were okay. Nothing special. My mom had a pasta, which I tried and we both agreed it was flavorless. My sister ordered the BBQ pizza which was pretty dang good, but not mind blowing. We were all pretty disappointed with our over priced food and under performing beverages.\n\nWe ordered dessert, we got the cookie jar sundae. It had every type of cookie on it, plus ice cream, and lots of fresh whipped cream. It was delightful. And definitely meant to be shared. This ended the meal on a nice note.\n\nThe service was excellent. The restaurant was clean. The entire staff was awesome. No complaints here on that end. \n\nI had such high hopes for this place! I really did, but it's a more expensive, less tasty version of the Cheesecake Factory.  As for people saying this place is fancy, give me a break. There were all walks of life here. The girls and guys going to the club, the grandmas, the Europeans with their fanny packs, and every other class and creed.\n\nStop in and get dessert and then bounce. There is a candy shop, a bar, and a chocolate lounge in this same space as well.\n\nSorry Sugar Factory, you just aren't that sweet.

It's Dillards at the Fashion Show Mall so I thought my experience might be less ghetto than one of the other malls.... [[Not]] [[so]] [[much]]! Let's [[start]] with parking.

Two [[ladies]] [[walking]] to a [[car]]. They first open the back of the car and start rifling through some bags. Then they go to the trunk and-more rifling. Then they decide to stop and have a deep conversation outside the car. By this point, I'm fuming but the place is [[packed]], do I wait.

[[Finally]] she walks back to the car and makes a five [[point]] [[turn]] to [[exit]] the space. But I digress....\n\nOnce inside the store, [[I]] headed to the ladies' dresses. They had a [[massive]] selection....for people size 10 and larger. I did find a dress that I didn't despise but I clearly needed a size larger than I found. Naturally, it was the last one so I decided I'd pick up Spanx and squeeze into this one rather than torture myself any longer. Off to shoes. I'm not a shopping fan so it did not thrill me that here too was a massive selection. I found two pair of shoes that looked perfect. I couldn't seem to get any hello even though employees were just standing around chatting about freeway directions. Finally, a young man did come help me. I received the first pair of shoes but he had yet to bring me the stockings to use for try-ons. I finally gave up on waiting and found them myself. The second pair of shoes were not available in anything other than behemoth size. The first pair was missing rhinestones on BOTH of the $80 shoes. I asked for another pair in my size but, alas, none were available. The young salesman gave a nervous smile and made a comment about small stones and glue not holding. I nearly made a comment about his stones but chose to quit while I was behind. I left the store extremely frustrated by my experience and was just thankful leaving the store was actually pleasant.

This restaurant was a [[great]] [[find]] for us on our recent vacation to Scottsdale, AZ.

We had no [[idea]] how [[great]] this would be.\n\nWe [[started]] off with some of their signature drinks and a [[bowl]] of their pretzel [[bites]] and cheese fondue.  [[It]] was [[fabulous]]!  [[We]] [[had]] to [[order]] an extra [[bowl]] of pretzel [[bites]] because they were [[so]] [[good]].  [[Then]] [[came]] the main course...  \n\nI asked the [[waiter]] for some recommendations of their \""specialty [[items]]\"", and he pointed me to their fried [[chicken]] with mashed potatoes, biscuits and honey drizzle (over all of it).  I was hesitant to order that for lunch because it was the middle of the [[day]], and I didn't want to be too full for the movie.  However, another waiter [[said]] [[I]] would \""[[love]] it\"" so I took the plunge.  And am [[I]] glad I [[did]]!\n\nThe [[crust]] on the chicken was so brown and crispy and the honey glaze gave it a hint of sweetness.

This restaurant was a [[large]] [[researching]] for us on our recent vacation to Scottsdale, AZ.  We were headed to a matinee showing of the Dark Knight Rises movie at Fashion Square Mall, [[afterwards]] we looked around for a place to grab lunch in the area.  \n\nWe picked Culinary Dropout because we [[wished]] the witty [[nomination]].  We had no [[insights]] how [[huge]] this would be.\n\nWe [[embark]] off with some of their signature drinks and a [[trophy]] of their pretzel [[hurts]] and cheese fondue.  [[He]] was [[noteworthy]]!  [[Yourself]] [[carried]] to [[rule]] an extra [[trophy]] of pretzel [[murdered]] because they were [[additionally]] [[befitting]].  [[Where]] [[carried]] the main course...  \n\nI asked the [[restaurant]] for some recommendations of their \""specialty [[thematic]]\"", and he pointed me to their fried [[byrd]] with mashed potatoes, biscuits and honey drizzle (over all of it).  I was hesitant to order that for lunch because it was the middle of the [[dating]], and I didn't want to be too full for the movie.  However, another waiter [[telling]] [[it]] would \""[[dear]] it\"" so I took the plunge.  And am [[me]] glad I [[didnt]]!\n\nThe [[scab]] on the chicken was so brown and crispy and the honey glaze gave it a hint of sweetness.

Bad costumer service! I'm walking around for 15 minutes trying to find a shopping cart to put my little one in, and they are nowhere to be found, I finally ask one of the cashiers where I can find any and she was rude and said \"" we don't have anymore, or they are scattered everywhere\"" first of all as I was walking around I didn't see any and second I probably saw 7 carts total that people were using, so if that's the case they need to get more carts or have there extra employee just walking around start gathering them up...so frustrated!

I live right around the corner from Los Cabos, and so I am particularly interested in having a good \""Mex\"" restaurant nearby. I've now been there probably two dozen times since they opened a few months ago, so I feel like I can give them a fair review. \nFirst, the owners are very very nice and interested in feedback. Second, the food is, on the whole, very very tasty and cheap. I am a particular fan of the tortas and burritos. The chorizo breakfast burrito is a knock-out as is the \""California Surfing\"" burrito, with carne asada, shrimp, french fries, and a garlicy sour cream sauce. \nThe only gripe I have is that the food isn't always consistent. I've twice had inedible items served to me. Once with a carne asada torta that was so over salted as to be inedible (and I really like salt) and once with a pollo asada burrito where the chicken was so dry as to not be chewable. These two extreme outliers (everything else I've ever had there -- including these two menu items on other occasions -- has been delicious) are just a symptom of lack of consistency that I hope will get ironed out soon. \nIt's also a big annoyance that their hours keep changing. When I want a burrito, I don't want to show up to find they're now closed on Sundays or only open at 10am in the morning when I've shown up at 9am. I think this will work out, though. \nI have my fingers crossed for them. The food is awesome 9 times out of 10 and the local friendliness makes up for the other times. At least, it will for now.

My friends and I stopped for lunch and what a treat.  The wait staff was super.  When my friend ordered iced tea, they actually brought a small container of simple syrup for him to sweeten his tea with.  I had the barbecued lamb cobb salad and it was amazing.  The bbq dry rub had a little kick and the lamb was rare and tender.  My friend had the roast pork sandwich.  The rub on the pork was fantastic.

If you need a 1 inch fork threaded, cut, and  you have no other option [[intro]] to [[Az]] bicycle. just [[creations]] sure you inspect your equipment when you leave. Did they do the job? Yes. Was it affordable? Yes. Would [[ya]] come back? No. Would I recommend? I'd recommend them for threading and cutting the fork, that's it. Receiving my bicycle with sensors out of place, brakes not ready, seat raised from where it was originally (by 6 inches), and a broken water [[impound]] makes me reluctant to return.

Tonight was our first and [[last]] visit to this place.

A bouncer had to run over and ask them all to leave. Later, two employees (one a manager of the place) loudly discussed the incident right by us.\n- They apparently ran out of ice, and when the manager was informed, she loudly swore and ran over to call the ice company.\n- Smokers were way too close to the entrances to the building. They also kept sitting on a bench right by our table - still inside the railing - and it just seemed too close to people eating. Maybe we're just spoiled at not having smokers in restaurants now.\n- The waitress Shelly was just unfriendly and not responsive beyond the initial wait. When we would give an order, she would absent mindedly look off in the distance and then have us repeat it. She got cranky when the 1 minute she gave our friend to look at the menu wasn't enough  and she had to come back later - then she waited 10 minutes before the next swing by. We are usually good tippers, but when she gave us the credit card slip without a pen to sign with and without even saying \""thank you\"" on a last attempt to be nice, we barely gave her anything.\n\nNothing redeeming this place.

Last night we fancied getting a Chinese so off we dived into the depths of Just Eat. Long story short we chose New Haven Express Chinese. I remember when they first opened and they had a huge sign outside advertising the fact that they sold ostrich meat - very intriguing. However, neither Joe or I had actually ordered food from here before.\n\nThe menu is vast to say the least. They have it all and all sorts of meats at very reasonable prices. I opted for Kung Po ostrich and it was absolutely delicious. Not only this but their delivery is SUPER fast.\n\nOverall here are the reasons I have given it 5 stars:\n- Huge menu\n- Unusual meat options\n- Great value for money\n- Delicious!\n\nMy only quibble is that their crispy seaweed seems slightly overpriced (\u00a33.50) but I can live with that :)

We ended up paying to paint an object but even when I told the girl we'd never done this before & required assistance she was only marginally helpful. I spent $40 and left irritated.

Went at about lunchtime on a Sunday, and there was only about a five minute wait. This is a busy little place, but seems worth the wait. The biscuits and gravy were very good, and the portions large. They have a nice selection of mini pies and the entire menu is available all day long. The waitress was very attentive and efficient, and the food was delish. I'll be back!

This is such a cool store and such a fun place to shop. They have everything you want for accessories: jewelry, scarves, hats, watches, bags, wallets, glasses, the list goes on. \nIt's conveniently organized by colors so you can shop by what you might need to match your style or clothing and there are so many items to choose from!!\nI find myself walking around the store so many times to make sure I haven't missed anything!\nNow the fun part is not just the huge selection, but the prices too. Items range from mostly $10-$30 with a few items above and below this, but it makes it affordable to try out a trend or experiment. \nVery fun store!

Well [[I]] used to [[like]] this mall, however, they have \""new\"" owners.The [[prior]] owner and manager turned out to be a real crook and stole revenue from [[many]] dealers. This all happened about a year - year and [[half]] [[ago]]. After a big fallout, nearly half the mall moved out. Enter the \""[[new]]\"" owners, who I hear are from [[Texas]]? These people have tons of stuff, that apparently they have been selling out of [[state]] [[prior]], most of it is from their own collections one could gather?  Slowly they have been staging their merchandise to [[look]] like [[individual]] collections and [[dealers]] for months. Over the past year what was [[left]] of the original dealers have since moved out, to other malls. The prices are higher than all the malls in [[Arizona]]. Perhaps they think they are in California? Santa Fe? They run an Auction service through the mall, but [[be]] careful, a good amount of the action items come from the floors and walls of the mall. They also have an Antique Store on eBay under the store name: Continental Collectibles and under the seller name of azantiquecentre. Just check out there eBay approval rating...OVER 500 [[NEGATIVE]] ratings from [[customers]]. It's almost unheard of to have a rating under 90% (their rating is 87%) on eBay without doing something wrong. Pretty sad if you ask me?  So this afternoon I venture into their store, I have not been in the place for 6-8 months prior. On my way out, I was \""Detained\"" because they thought I had stolen a piece of art on July 1st. They had a blurry security camera photo that was kinda close but as I pointed out, without my reading glasses on, that there were MAJOR differences. But they called the Scottsdale police anyway. I'm 68 year old male and have never been arrested for anything in my life. I was shocked that they would not spend a few seconds comparing the photo with the person standing in front of them. After an hour of questioning and harassment the cops let me go. A bad experience in a bad Antique Mall that will remain bad as long as it's current owners and manger run it. If you don't think so, then just ask all of the former dealers that use to rent spaces from them. Currently I think there are maybe three or four left. 90% of that inventory comes from these \""new\"" owners.

And don't think you can get away with serving mediocre grub just because you call yourself a diner.  Especially when you're charging $9 or more for some plates.

It usually is a mix of Ethiopian, Guatemalen and Sumatran or other roast.  Anyway - I can't say that I have been to  a whole lot of different coffee bars in Phoenix,  but the ones I have been to don't  measure up in flavor, freshness and robust flavor of the beans. [[Nor]] can anyone  [[match]]  the friendliness and unpretentiousness of the staff. \n\n I have only tried the scones and muffins.   Scones are a difficult feat in most places but Copper Star [[has]] some of the tastiest.  [[Try]] the chocolate chip or cranberry walnut scone.   During the fall they make homemade pumpkin muffins  (using fresh pumpkin) that are to die for.  They run out so fast you have to get there early.  I wish they would offer these year round.Yum!    Because of the coffee, service , and the limited # of goodies I have tried so far, plus their community involvement,  I am giving this place 5 stars.\nThe patio is very small  with a nice fountain and you can bring your dog - After your coffee take Fido across the street for a bath at Wag-N-Wash (but that is a different review).  So, if you happen to be in the neighborhood stop by and check out Copper Star.  You'll be glad you did. \n(Say Hi to \""Mr Bill \"" for me!)

When our son started here 2 [[years]] [[ago]] it was amazing . The instructors were phenomenal and my son really LOVED karate.  They pushed several competitions throughout the year so we decided to train for one and try it.  My son was only 4 at the time of his first competition.  We paid A LOT of money on top of the already expensive tuition to have one on one sessions to train for competition.  When it came time for the competition we found out they don't send their instructors and we were completely on our own.  EVERY other studio sends instructors along with a team of supporters for their competitors.  We continued to compete, and the kids who represented Sandoval usually ended up with first place wins.  Their training and trainer was amazing, but was often denied permission to attend competitions.  The kids were NEVER recognized for their achievements on their website or Facebook page.  Karate was my son's main passion and now it's really [[fizzled]] out.  He was in the same class for over 9 months and had so many younger/new kids join that he completely dominated the class when the sparred.... not in a good way because it didn't make him any better of a fighter.  Sad to see it go downhill so fast but we won't [[be]] back.

After reading [[so]] many [[great]] reviews [[I]] was excited to try this place, we passed by it a hundred [[times]] because it shares the shopping plaza with our favorite Chicago-style pizza place, Amore. We dined in on a week night, we were told booths were reserved but we had our choice of table. We got seated and looked over the menu, we narrowed down our selections and waited, and waited, and waited for someone to take our order.\n\nFinally, our server appeared, we wanted a few rolls: Kiss Me, Lisa Lisa, and WSOP.  She told us not to choose Kiss Me, she says many don't like it. She suggested GT-R, instead. Fine by us, our diet cokes were soon [[delivered]]. They had an [[odd]] [[taste]], like peppermint or something. Our rolls arrived and we dug in, it was only the WSOP roll we were fond of, it had yellowtail and jalapeno. We were still hungry, but we asked for the check, we were put-off by this point. Our total was $40 for two drinks and three rolls. The rolls were not [[worth]] $12.50, pricey, especially to leave hungry... I'll stick to Hokaido Sushi, it's closer to home, tastier and a better value. I paid the tab, and my husband placed an order for a pizza. So, we did not go hungry, but it was an expensive appetizer.

One of my favorite spots in Charlotte for sushi! Their sushi lunch buffet is delicious and garlic noodles are a must. Try out their mixed drinks as they always have something new and fresh! The sushi is very fresh and the atmosphere is unique in Charlotte. Their new lounge and jellyfish tank are must-see while enjoying Pisces' food.

Anyone who is looking to volunteer in Las Vegas, start here. The staff is very friendly.  I just had my first experience at their dinner service. It is very organized, clean,  and those who are in need are very gracious and friendly as well. Will definitely continue to volunteer here, they do great work and have established meaningful relationships with those in need.

This is the [[worst]] I hop I have even in ,its on the  south side  of the strip I was leaving Vegas around 11:00am parking was really bad because its located is a area where there is a outlet in the rear plus other restaurants I spent about 3 to 4 mins .looking for a parking space, there was a line to put your name on the list to be seated that took about 20 mins. order food came out in about 20 mins. food was just OK but you know even bad food taste good if you are really hungry. I had to wait about 10 to pay my bill, the staff was very nice and friendly.

[[I]] am [[warning]] anyone that loves their Pet to NEVER go to this hospital for any type of service for your pet.  I took my dog there to have some simple fatty cell lumps removed and it was a disaster.  They [[offered]] us a discounted [[rate]] if we also had our dog's teeth cleaned.  Well, my [[dog]] [[got]] SEPSIS (blood poisoning) from them [[infecting]] him while they were cleaning his teeth and my dog passed away 48 hours later.  [[I]] loved my dog for 8 years and he was healthy and happy [[prior]] to them [[infecting]] him with this [[deadly]] disease.  I had a necropsy (autopsy) done to prove their negligence and [[offered]] this to them and they provided me with no [[apologies]] and [[tried]] to do everything they could to [[deny]] wrong doing.  I am now fighting with them over [[reimbursement]] for my loss [[since]] that is all I have left.

I absolutely LOVED staying at the Vdara, and will absolutely be back.  \n\nFirst off... if you're a smoker or a gambler, this may not be your thing, but for someone like me who doesn't smoke and really couldn't care less about being in a casino... this was AWESOME.  \n\nWe arrived in Vegas at about 10am on a Wednesday and right from the time we arrived in the hotel lobby, things went really, really well.  The person who was helping us with checking in was very friendly, chatty and very personable.  And, she  arranged to get us upgraded to a room that was one level above what we had booked, but because it was so early in the morning our room wasn't ready yet.  No worries - off to the pool!  \n\nWhen the room was eventually ready, we were duly impressed.  On the 51st floor and overlooking the Bellagio fountain with a super comfy bed and TVs on both the bed side as well as the living room side of the room... it was perfect.  There were only 2 very minor complaints about the room: one - that the water pressure coming out of the shower was pretty lame (though this was made up for by the fact that the water was HOT within seconds of turning it on); and two - that there weren't robes already provided in the room.  Minor, I know - but I'm a girl who likes to relax in a robe and slippers, and quite frankly, every other hotel I've stayed at on the strip in Vegas has just provided them in the room already.  Not a big deal as you can call down to housekeeping and have some brought up for you, but when you're fresh out of the shower and just want a soft, comfy robe to put on you want it already there in the room.  First world problems.  \n\nOther REALLY good things about this place were the concierge service people.  They seriously rocked.  Not only did they get our Cirque Du Soleil tickets printed for us and have them ready, but also made a reservation for us at a steak restaurant in a competing hotel that had NO reservations available when we tried to book earlier in the night.  Wifi was free in the rooms, and I was able to pick up signal in both the pool and lobby areas by just logging on with our last name and room number.  I also loved the pool area - there were tons of lounge chairs, umbrellas to put up when it got stupid hot in the sun, and the waitresses were always happy to bring drinks.   The mojitos were fabulous!!  \n\nIn short - I was sad to leave.  I would have stayed for another few days if only I had that much vacation time to take, but alas, as of Saturday night it was back to reality.  \n\nThanks to the staff at Vdara - we'll definitely be back!
