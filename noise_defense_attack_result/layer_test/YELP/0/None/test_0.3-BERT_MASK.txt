So the food was decent, the service was absolutely terrible and I was charged for a soda when all I got was carbonated water... I asked why and the poor waiter said that when they don't charge for it, the owner takes it out of their check.. Are you kidding me? Not like I needed 2 dollars, and not like it was a big deal but it was when the waiter told me about the owner. I will never be back and don't recommend. It looks like they are struggling anyways so good luck attempting to obtain clients with the way you practice  your business and treat your employees. If you are the owner, and you want to reach out to me and talk about it let me know. I'd love to give you a piece of my mind.

I'm going to be residing here for a while, so I needed a place I could call home.

If you show up at a cigar bar, you should be able to enjoy it there.  \n\nWe found this [[place]] relatively [[easily]].  It's in a strip mall, but the interior is very comfortable.  The decor instantly made me feel welcome and at home.  The [[staff]] was welcoming as well.  They made sure to greet us as we walked in the door, and the humidor is large.  The only downside is on the day we visited a majority of our favorites had been purchased by like minded [[patrons]].  The exterior of the place [[does]] not [[meet]] the interior.  (Insert Doctor Who \""It's bigger on the inside\"" reference.\n\nThe staff made some excellent suggestions on local brews, and if we wanted to, we could try out many of the beverages to see if we liked it before we bought it.  The selection of their [[beers]] and beverages was extensive.  \n\nSecondly, I cannot emphasize the importance for any business to focus on customer service.  The staff here had it down.  [[While]] it was a bit slow for a Friday night, the staff was eager to help, taking the opportunity to focus on the customers.  I've been to many a bar where it's a slow [[night]] and the bar staff is too [[busy]] goofing off to pay attention to you.  These guys were professional.\n\nThirdly, if you find yourself stranded in the beautiful deserts of Arizona, make sure and visit this place.  It's worth your time.

We ordered take out from here for dinner last night. \n\nAfter paying our $70 tab (3 soups, 2 rolls), we opened the containers up at home to be incredibly disappointed. The soups were just ok, not the same quality as the first time, not horrible but just OK. \n\nThe sushi is where we were REALLY pissed off. $15/roll to get 6 pieces of what looks like BUDGET SUSHI. We could have gone to Yume Sushi and gotten a kick ass awesome sushi roll (or two!) for that price but apparently here, it gets you a 6 piece baked (microwaved) rice roll with hardly any other ingredients smothered in \""spicy\"" (not) mayo sauce with the teensiest bit of roe sprinkled on top. \n\nI'm not gonna lie, I TOTALLY felt downright ROBBED on this meal and I am not a happy camper about it.

This Checkers location is new to the area having only been open a few weeks at the time of this review.  It did not take me long to get there to give it a try though I did allow for the few weeks to pass giving the staff a chance to work out any glitches to their processs.  On my first of what will likely be many visits over the foreseeable future I went with my co-workers.  My boss ordered a BLT and the Baconzilla Fries.  The fries did not last long as she went hog wild on the cheesey bacon topped goodness.  The BLT, however, is still waiting for her.  Not because it is bad but because the fries were so good and so filling.  A different co-worker ordered the heart attack special with a side of all around good badness.  She got the Bacon Roadhouse Burger hold the BBQ sauce, a small order of seasoned fries and the Monsterella Cheese Sticks (fried mozarella).  It all looked great and she gave me the two thumbs up sign when I asked how she enjoyed it all.  That is a definitive [[win]] from her.  As for me, I ordered the double fish sandwich.  Think about a double Filet-O-Fish from McDonalds and add shredded lettuce.  It was about like that but by the time I got back to the office the fish had gone soggy and lost its crispy integrity.  I'll take McDonalds for the win on this one.  Besides, not much beats the bun McDonalds uses for their fish sandwich.  Anyhow, I also ordered the Fully Loaded Fries.  They are topped with melty cheese, ranch dressing and bacon bits (real bacon).  I ate about half before getting interrupted with work stuff so I set them aside and finished them the next day.  I liked the fries but they were very salty from being seasoned fries topped with cheese and bacon.  It was a little much but to at least have tried them I am happy.  Next time I go I may try either a chicken sandwich of some sort or perhaps one of the many burgers Checkers has to offer.  I would also try the cheese sticks.  They looked amazing and when dipped in marinara they must taste as good as they look.  I would also like to try some of the dessert options in the future.  They have some unique ice cream treats that sound incredible.  This food may not be good for the body but fast food rarely is.  This is food good for the mind.  You can't help but be happy at a place that serves up as much bacon as Checkers does.

My friend got a burger that was dry and very small for $10.

NISHisHOT doesn't take shit from NOBODY.\n\nNO body.\n\nEspecially at restaurants.\n\nSo if you want to offer a ginger infused lychee martini.  And it tastes like the vodka that comes straight out of my freezer.  Well . . . \n\nIt SUCKS.  It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen. \n\nAnd if you want to offer Mackerel on your sushi menu that's as stale as the Talk Threads on Yelp.  Well . . . \n\nIt's UNACCEPTABLE.  It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen.\n\nBut if you offer. . . tiradito and lobster and oysters and sashimi and black cod and lions and tigers and a baby gorilla (it's Vegas, baby.  Vegas) . . .   that break-dances on your tastebuds and plays the drumline on your tonsils.   \n\nWell . . . It gets it's ass sent to my dancing buddha belly.  Happy buddha belly.\n\n5 Stars.  A couple mishaps that got sent back to the kitchen and off the check.   But the other food more than made up for it.  Including the baby gorilla.  And the excellent, good looking service.\n\nAnd about that check.  Well.  Shocking.  Stabbing.  No that's not my heart.  It's my wallet exploding.\n\nSo  . . . 5 Stars to my boyfriend for always knowing that I'm always better at being a drama mamma than ever paying for dinner.  \n\n(Okay!  So I had to wash his underwear for a month.  It's Vegas, baby.  Vegas)\n\nNISHisHOT doesn't take shit from NOBODY.

These guys are top [[notch]].  First, to be clear, I drive a 2006 Jeep Liberty 4x4 NOT. A German [[car]]. With that said, I have an awesome (but very rare) European diesel version with a 2.8 liter VMotori  turbo diesel.  The Jeep dealers [[hate]] it because they don't really have any [[true]] diesel techs. The big diesel specialists only know Ford, Dodge, and Chevy and don't understand small European diesels. I found these guys on a Jeep CRD forum recommending them for local shop that will do honest, high quality work. (And the owner's wife has the same CRD Jeep as me, so he knows it top to bottom.)\n\nThere is no one else in the state of Arizona that I [[trust]] to work on my [[little]] Jeep. End of story.

Went on Saturday 12/20/14 for lunch and the 3 of us were seated immediately which was nice, however, we ordered and waited an hour for our food while others around us who were seated after us were being served. Just as we were trying to track down an employee to call a manager to our table after waiting an hour for our food, the server walking towards us had 2 of our 3 plates. We asked him to have the manager come to our table and his response was \""but I have your food here, do you not want it?\"". One of my friends stated \""Surely, we will take the food but can you please still have a manager come see us?\"". We had no silverware to begin eating and waiting for the 3rd plate. We had to track down another waitress and ask for a manager again as some time had passed and there was still no manager in site, nor the 3rd plate of food. The 3rd plate of food finally came out and we asked for silverware and began eating. Throughout the meal, still no manager. The waiter (Carl) was nice and did come around a few times to ask if everything tasted ok. After we were completely done eating, still no manager. Carl came to the table and stated the kitchen was \""backed up and having issues\"" he then stated the assistant manager was the only one working that day and he/she couldn't step out as he/she was assisting the kitchen in getting back on track. He then stated he was able to comp us ($11.00) and apologized for the service. \n\nAs we knew it was not the waiter's fault, we were extremely disappointed in the hour wait, no silverware, and no manager after requesting he/she twice. The cherry on top was the fact that the assistant manager essentially could not come out for a few minutes to speak with a dissatisfied customer. Extremely unprofessional.
