Just showed up to Phoenix with a buddy looking for a place to hang out that resembled the fabled Mort's Martini Bar of Wichita, Kansas.  I'm going to be residing here for a while, so I needed a place I could call home.  Magnums is quite a good location, and while it's no Mort's, it is definitely a place I could find myself quite often.\n\nFirstly, let me tell you, finding a place where you can enjoy your cigar and a beverage at the same time is exceedingly hard to do in this modern day of social awareness and health babysitting.  If you show up at a cigar bar, you should be able to enjoy it there.  \n\nWe found this place relatively easily.  It's in a strip mall, but the interior is very comfortable.  The decor instantly made me feel welcome and at home.  The staff was welcoming as well.  They made sure to greet us as we walked in the door, and the humidor is large.  [[The]] only [[downside]] is on the day we visited a majority of our favorites had been purchased by like minded patrons.  The exterior of the place does not meet the interior.  (Insert Doctor Who \""It's bigger on the inside\"" reference.\n\nThe staff made some excellent suggestions on local brews, and if we wanted to, we could try out many of the beverages to see if we liked it before we bought it.  The selection of their beers and beverages was extensive.  \n\nSecondly, I cannot emphasize the importance for any business to focus on customer service.  The staff here had it down.  While it was a bit slow for a Friday night, the staff was eager to help, taking the opportunity to focus on the customers.  I've been to many a bar where it's a slow night and the bar staff is too busy goofing off to pay attention to you.  These guys were professional.\n\nThirdly, if you find yourself stranded in the beautiful deserts of Arizona, make sure and visit this place.  It's worth your time.  I will be back, and it's earned a five star from me.  Glad to have been here!\nThirdly,

We ordered take out from here for dinner last night. \n\nAfter paying our $70 tab (3 soups, 2 rolls), we opened the containers up at home to be incredibly disappointed. The soups were just ok, not the same quality as the first time, not horrible but just OK. \n\nThe sushi is where we were REALLY pissed off. $15/roll to get 6 pieces of what looks like BUDGET SUSHI. We could have gone to Yume Sushi and gotten a kick ass awesome sushi roll (or two!) for that price but apparently here, it gets you a 6 piece baked (microwaved) rice roll with hardly any other ingredients smothered in \""spicy\"" (not) mayo sauce with the teensiest bit of roe sprinkled on top. \n\nI'm not gonna lie, I TOTALLY felt downright ROBBED on this meal and I am not a happy camper about it. The food quality for the prices charged is insane. \n\nI won't be back.

So the food was decent, the service was absolutely terrible and I was charged for a soda when all I got was carbonated water... I asked why and the poor waiter said that when they don't charge for it, the owner takes it out of their check.. Are you kidding me? Not like I needed 2 dollars, and not like it was a big deal but it was when the waiter told me about the owner. I will never be back and don't recommend. It looks like they are struggling anyways so good luck attempting to obtain clients with the way you practice  your business and treat your employees. If you are the owner, and you want to reach out to me and talk about it let me know. I'd love to give you a piece of my mind.

Very terrible service. I booked and paid for three hotel rooms with 2 beds for my whole family with 8 people online.When we arrived to the hotel and we are getting ready to check in, they told me that there is no more 2 beds rooms available at this time. They only have 1 beds. They said tbey cannot gurantee the rooms !!! They even gave us wrong hotel keys to someone else's hotel room. We were so surprised walking into an occupied room. We had to come back to the front desk and file a complaint. We ended up taking the 1 beds room since the kids were tired. A few of us slept on the floor. I will never recommend coming back with such bad service they provided.

This is a nice place to go.  I was here around 3 en la manana, was the only party there.  Everything was clean.  \n\nThey are cash only.\n\nFrom what I remember the carne asada fries were very very large.  They don't come with salsa, which I guess is common for non Los Angeles mexican restaurants from which I order carne fries from, but nevertheless you can add from salsa bar.  Comes with fries carne asada, cheese, gwak, sour cream, and a hint of refried beans (those are the mashed ones, not the whole beans).  \n\nThe rest of my party ordered: taco, tostada, and chimichanga.  All of these looked delicious as well.  [[Too]] [[bad]] I didn't get a bite.\n\n\nAlso tried the lingua tacos (cow tongue) that I did not order but was offered a bite.  They were pretty decent, for being tongue and for never trying them before.  Had the texture of soft beef brisket and tofu, but tasted like turkey.    \n\nIf you feed them to you cat you can say, \""Cat got your tongue?\""

This Checkers location is new to the area having only been open a few weeks at the time of this review.  It did not take me long to get there to give it a try though I did allow for the few weeks to pass giving the staff a chance to work out any glitches to their processs.  On my first of what will likely be many visits over the foreseeable future I went with my co-workers.  My boss ordered a BLT and the Baconzilla Fries.  The fries did not last long as she went hog wild on the cheesey bacon topped goodness.  The BLT, however, is still waiting for her.  Not because it is bad but because the fries were so good and so filling.  A different co-worker ordered the heart attack special with a side of all around good badness.  She got the Bacon Roadhouse Burger hold the BBQ sauce, a small order of seasoned fries and the Monsterella Cheese Sticks (fried mozarella).  It all looked great and she gave me the two thumbs up sign when I asked how she enjoyed it all.  That is a definitive [[win]] from her.  As for me, I ordered the double fish sandwich.  Think about a double Filet-O-Fish from McDonalds and add shredded lettuce.  It was about like that but by the time I got back to the office the fish had gone soggy and lost its crispy integrity.  I'll take McDonalds for the win on this one.  Besides, not much beats the bun McDonalds uses for their fish sandwich.  Anyhow, I also ordered the Fully Loaded Fries.  They are topped with melty cheese, ranch dressing and bacon bits (real bacon).  I ate about half before getting interrupted with work stuff so I set them aside and finished them the next day.  I liked the fries but they were very salty from being seasoned fries topped with cheese and bacon.  It was a little much but to at least have tried them I am happy.  Next time I go I may try either a chicken sandwich of some sort or perhaps one of the many burgers Checkers has to offer.  I would also try the cheese sticks.  They looked amazing and when dipped in marinara they must taste as good as they look.  I would also like to try some of the dessert options in the future.  They have some unique ice cream treats that sound incredible.  This food may not be good for the body but fast food rarely is.  This is food good for the mind.  You can't help but be happy at a place that serves up as much bacon as Checkers does.

Been wanting to try here for awhile and finally had a chance during Arizona Restaurant Week. My wife and I were both satisfied with our meals. The Stetson salad is as good as advertised!  Due to the [[couscous]] base, we had [[leftover]] that we were able to eat the next day. My wife had the short ribs which were very tender. I had the [[lamb]] lollipops which were okay but I'd probably get something else if I went back. The restaurant is pretty expensive so thats a definite drawback for a return visit.

As an avid coffee fan, I have to say that Caribou has won me over. They have free Wi-Fi, which is great if you find yourself in the area and you need to do some work via computer. When you walk in the door, you feel like you've left the Southside and entered a cozy ski lodge. They even have a fireplace surrounded by big, comfy chairs -definitely a plus when you're looking for a place to relax and sip on some espresso. \n\nOne of the cool things about Caribou is that it has a wider variety of menu items than your typical coffee shop. The oatmeal (try their Blueberry Almond flavor, so good!), breakfast sandwiches and snacks are much better than what you can get at your local Starbucks. If you're not a coffee person, Caribou also has some really good flavored teas. Overall, a great place to get your caffeine fix.

My family and I were in town for my nieces college graduation. The waitress at Joes Crab Shack told us to try Poppys because it was last call at Joes (that's how we roll). Being responsible and not driving intoxicated we walked down and was not disappointed. Fran was very accommodating to our party and even opened the kitchen up for our late night munchies. We were introduced to Poppys Punch which I highly recommend and it was nice to hang out on the patio. We had a great time and intend to drop in again when we're in the area.

Excellent, flavorful, spicy, authentic Szechuan fare and hearty servings. The hot & sour soup was loaded with tofu, egg, veggies as it should be and plenty of flavor, not just pepper. We loved the eggplant and garlic,sweet, spicy and tender. The flaming chicken is terrific, with wonderful vegetables, aromatics and plenty of pepper oil and red peppers. The tea smoked duck was a bit too salty and the skin was not as crispy as I would have liked but edible. We look forward to, our next visit.

The restaurant is very nice on the inside compared to the outside. I nice place for a date.\n\nI ordered the tom kah gai and it was very flavorful, not quite as rich with coconut milk as at Thai Rama, but still very good. I ordered medium and this is probably closer to hot. As I ate, I noticed these things I thought were green onion, on further examination, they were small sliced chili peppers. Their rice was nit as fluffy as I usually like, but that's ok. I also got the red curry because the server said it was their most popular curry. Again, very flavorful and tasty.

Two fitness centers, two [[pool]] complexes that [[include]] cabanas and BBQs, TWO business centers with [[complimentary]] FAX & internet [[use]].  There is a lovely little trail just behind the property great for walking the pups and meeting peeps & dog-poo bags all through the property.  Although there is not a gated or [[patch]] of [[grass]] [[designated]] for animals, so as [[long]] as you're cool with [[going]] for a walk on a pretty [[trail]], then you'll [[enjoy]] this [[pet]] [[experience]]. \n\nThe [[staff]] was [[always]] [[incredibly]] friendly!!!  The maintenance crew was great too!!  They have an [[online]] maintenance submission where if you have issues or need assistance with something in your apartment you can submit a request online and they get [[back]] to you [[promptly]].  Paying [[rent]] is a [[breeze]] too, with their online payment system.\n\nGarages are optional and do come with an additional fee. They're VERY small, one car.  So if you're a crappy driver, I don't suggest gettting one, you'll probably bang your car up just trying to get in.\n\nAll the apartments are fully equiptped with a stacked washer/dryer combo, GE appliances, walk-in closets and oversized garden tubs (not to be confused with jacuzzi tubs, there are no jets in these ones).\n\nI NEVER once, no joke, heard my neighbors.  EXCEPT when someone was walking down the hall, that's it.  So no apartment noise.  They also give you the option to choose from several paint colors, for an additional fee of course.  They're newer and very nice, HOWEVER, as I moved out, they were running a lot of new tenant specials and it appeared to be attracting interesting folks.  Which is not bad, but I did notice a lot more trash being left around.  Whatever, I'm oober picky.  \nBut rent is negotiable, I weaseled my way into a much lower monthly rent.  So try it, don't be shy!\n\nDo take a gander on their website to see the different floor plans, pictures and other amenities. :)  Good luck!  It has my stamp of approval.

Although there is not a gated or [[stamps]] of [[spices]] [[identified]] for animals, so as [[anymore]] as you're cool with [[gonna]] for a walk on a pretty [[runway]], then you'll [[receive]] this [[fart]] [[like]]. \n\nThe [[employing]] was [[traditionally]] [[horribly]] friendly!!!  The maintenance crew was great too!!  They have an [[internet]] maintenance submission where if you have issues or need assistance with something in your apartment you can submit a request online and they get [[repaid]] to you [[prematurely]].  Paying [[condominiums]] is a [[overcast]] too, with their online payment system.\n\nGarages are optional and do come with an additional fee. They're VERY small, one car.  So if you're a crappy driver, I don't suggest gettting one, you'll probably bang your car up just trying to get in.\n\nAll the apartments are fully equiptped with a stacked washer/dryer combo, GE appliances, walk-in closets and oversized garden tubs (not to be confused with jacuzzi tubs, there are no jets in these ones).\n\nI NEVER once, no joke, heard my neighbors.  EXCEPT when someone was walking down the hall, that's it.  So no apartment noise.  They also give you the option to choose from several paint colors, for an additional fee of course.  They're newer and very nice, HOWEVER, as I moved out, they were running a lot of new tenant specials and it appeared to be attracting interesting folks.  Which is not bad, but I did notice a lot more trash being left around.  Whatever, I'm oober picky.  \nBut rent is negotiable, I weaseled my way into a much lower monthly rent.  So try it, don't be shy!\n\nDo take a gander on their website to see the different floor plans, pictures and other amenities. :)  Good luck!  It has my stamp of approval.

I absolutely love this hotel. When my boyfriend and I checked in they asked us if we wanted watered bottles, which was really  nice. The look of the hotel was very pretty..when I [[walked]] into our room there was a light, nice smelling [[scent]]. The room is definitely cleaner than most hotels I've been to. [[The]] [[decor]] was very pretty as well. In the morning we got free [[breakfast]] that serves from 6-10am. Their breakfast was beyond what we were [[expecting]]. Very [[delicious]] with [[bacon]], eggs, bagels, etc. I definitely would [[recommend]] anyone who's stopping by Scottsdale to try this hotel. [[Completely]] in [[love]] with it! Oh and one more thing, we booked through Expedia so our one bed-room was only 40 dollars (tax included) for a Friday night. [[How]] [[cheap]] is that for such a nice [[hotel]]? Definitely go there!

I went to this venue for the Carnivore's tour last month and was really pleased with my experience again. This time when I went, we were in a slightly different section and the lighting was WAY better. The line of sight to the show was great, and although I'd prefer to be closer to the stage, it was a great experience. Awesome show, great accommodations.

[[I]] was at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort for a [[conference]] and I had paid for a booth in the Hohokam [[Ballroom]] for [[three]] days.

The bites were so [[itchy]] that they kept us both up at night for a week even while constantly applying medication.

The Director of Security called me back and said his boss wouldn't allow him to give me a managers contact information.\n\nAfter this I e-mailed the resort and was told that since I didn't pay to stay in a hotel room and only paid to stay in the Hohokam Ballroom that they couldn't do anything about it even though this happened on their property and they did nothing about it.

Ate there last night with a group of friends.  The waitstaff was friendly, but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night.  I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.  The fries that went along with it were also extremely salty.  A couple people in the group said their food was okay, but definitely not worth a trip back.  I was quite bummed about this.

Unfortunately I had the worst customer service experience I have had in a really long time. I had to repeatedly ask for drink orders. My friend asked twice to place an order and the order got ignored. We tried to ask another waiter but when asked he said that we had to place it with our waiter and e was going to go get him. Twice we did this the waiter never came. TWO hours later we never got our drinks!!!\n\nIt was honestly the worst case of just not giving a F&#k by the employees there. \n\n\nThe only reason this place deserves a one star is because the food we had was good, even though ordering the food was also quite a challenge.

Malmaison (bad house) is about [[right]], but MerdeMaison is much more fitting.

How wrong I was.  \n\nAt first [[glance]], the place looks impressive with quirky, fun [[decor]]. But it's all about the details, isn't it?  While the room was [[well]] furnished and large, the phone didn't work at all through the entire stay (and [[nobody]] [[came]] to fix it after maintenance made an appearance on day 1). So every time we [[needed]] anything, we had to go down to the front desk ([[see]] detail on [[staff]] [[attitude]] later in this [[review]]).  [[In]] [[addition]], the [[beds]] were like wooden [[planks]]. \[[n]]\nAnd the [[breakfast]] was [[AWFUL]].  Food two of the days was only partially [[cooked]] and [[inedible]].  I'd [[upgraded]] our initial rate to include a full [[breakfast]] as part of a [[NYE]] package -- the [[upgrade]] cost about $100 US for two guests for three days.  But when we got to the [[cafe]] we were [[told]] our [[package]] only included the continental [[choice]] and we'd have to pay extra for additional items.  Seriously ... that is expensive bread and pastry (which I don't even eat).  So the desk manager (I assume that was his title), after a discussion, told me he was only upgrading our breakfast package to include meat to keep me happy (delivered in a very snide tone and smirk -- complete with eye roll).\n\nWhich brings us to the [[hotel]] staff.  Most importantly to me, about 50 percent of staff was extremely rude -- beyond the norm of European travel. I can tolerate a little bit of sassy attitude, but this was shockingly insulting.\n\nLastly, I'd paid in full two months in advance of the stay only to be presented a bill for 10 percent more at checkout. The girl at the desk could not explain it, only point to line items and shrug.  I'm still not sure why I was charged the additional fee (probably a malicious mark-up for the inedible breakfast) ... I'll probably never know.\n\nI should have followed my instincts initially and booked the Balmoral.  Much more spendy, but worth every single penny.  \n\nI will NEVER again stay at a MerdeMaison property.  But as I don't think the Malmaison brand can possibly last with this type of service, hopefully nobody will have to.

But when we got to the [[caffe]] we were [[this]] our [[plot]] only included the continental [[favorites]] and we'd have to pay extra for additional items.  Seriously ... that is expensive bread and pastry (which I don't even eat).  So the desk manager (I assume that was his title), after a discussion, told me he was only upgrading our breakfast package to include meat to keep me happy (delivered in a very snide tone and smirk -- complete with eye roll).\n\nWhich brings us to the [[accommodation]] staff.  Most importantly to me, about 50 percent of staff was extremely rude -- beyond the norm of European travel. I can tolerate a little bit of sassy attitude, but this was shockingly insulting.\n\nLastly, I'd paid in full two months in advance of the stay only to be presented a bill for 10 percent more at checkout. The girl at the desk could not explain it, only point to line items and shrug.  I'm still not sure why I was charged the additional fee (probably a malicious mark-up for the inedible breakfast) ... I'll probably never know.\n\nI should have followed my instincts initially and booked the Balmoral.  Much more spendy, but worth every single penny.  \n\nI will NEVER again stay at a MerdeMaison property.  But as I don't think the Malmaison brand can possibly last with this type of service, hopefully nobody will have to.

Really nice Brunch.   There was a line but we had reservations and were seated immediately.  Our waitress was terrific.  She stopped by with the specials to show us what was available.  Very attentive and helpful.  W had the Brunch that included a cream filled crepe with berry puree, eggs provencale, and beautiful croissant.  We did have to ask for the berry puree because the kitchen forgot to put it on the plate and it was oh so good!  \n\nThe duck confit was melt in you mouth tasty!

Thanks to Anita for reminding me how [[awful]] this mall is!  I rarely meet a that I cannot find some reason to like.  When it comes to this one, [[I]] say just pass it up.  With so much fabulous shopping to be had at The Fashion Show Mall, The Forum Shops and even The Bellagio's shopping area, you could skip this and go to a spa instead!  She is right about the enormous crowds of people here.  The walk ways are pretty narrow which makes things worse.  The stores are the worst of the worst and the people working in them are miserable.  Ooh, I just thought of one thing I could like here.....there is a restaurant owned by IL Fornaio called \""Canaletto\"".  We ate here once and it was pretty good.  Too bad the overall awfulness of the Venetian keeps us away.

I [[hate]] to be the one of unpopular opinion here, but my overall [[experience]] here wasn't that great. \n\nDrinks were decent, amuse bouche of asparagus mousse was pretty good, and the souffles were fabulous as described.\n\nHowever, [[neither]] of our entrees were good. My husband got the vegetarian crepes (the only vegetarian item on the menu) and found them pleasing at first, but overpowering after a few bites. I tasted it, too - it's like whoever created it didn't actually try to sit down and eat a whole one.\n\nFor me, the lobster was so [[tough]] and [[stringy]] that I had a difficult time cutting it with a knife. [[No]] delicious dessert can make up for that sort of problem. \n\nOh, I forgot, we ordered sides as well. The potato croquettes were pretty good as long as they were piping hot. Once the temperature went more toward warm, you could taste the [[grease]], which to me is not ideal.\n\nI'm happy to pay a premium for a great meal/service/ambience, but I expected much better from this place, especially in Vegas where competition is stiff.

Drove into Pittsburgh really late at night. So late the city had pretty much shut up shop. Walked around Station Square for literally an hour passing this place three times before finally having lost all sense of reason and succumbed to the kitsch seafood decor, flying shark with mardi-gras beads in its mouth and party lights. I am allergic to crab but thought hey you only live once right?! and ordered the lobster and king crab steam pot from the extra super buff teenage [[waiter]] whose shirt was so tight I could not understand how he could carry around a tray full of food. He was [[pleasant]] enough and although the place was practically empty he was never around when I wanted him and always around asking if I needed anything while I was stuffing my face full of sea creatures. The steampot was fine but the whole box of spices they add to it completely ruin the dish and I shudder to think they try to do that to hide how not-so-fresh the seafood is..ugh..Well I didn't have my face in a toilet or have exploding diarrhoea after or die from sea creature poisoning so there's a plus. The prices are really high for what they serve but Pittsburgh is pretty far from the ocean. On the plus side I love trains and you can sit right next to the train line and not even hear them pass every 20mins. Also the view across to the city is amazing across the river framed by the monumental massive amount of bridges and you are literally steps from the funicular to walk off your dinner. So whats the lesser of two evils this place or the Hard Rock Crappe next door?

Gather around little Yelpers, let me tell you about my stay at ye ol' Treasure Island. No, but seriously get ready to hear it.\n\nWe had the penthouse suite here. Our room was beautifully decorated and looked real crisp. Being an all guys birthday weeknd, we wanted to go all out. As soon as entering the room, we immediately fired up the jacuzzi. And 10 minutes later there was water all over the floor due to my fellow comrade who thinks it's not a problem to cannonball indoors. The staff handled the situation pretty well actually. They hand soaked and air dryed the room while we were out and the room looked handy dandy when we returned that night.\n\nBeing a fairly rowdy group, being loud was a given. Things got a little wierd for us two days in. Our room was the first room on the hall we were in, and they actually had a person standing by our room 24/7. I asked why was this necessary, but the staff all told me they were doing what they were told by the relief and higher class. I'm conviced they were keeping an eye on us.\nThe pool area was [[exceptional]]. I mean, it's not a Wet Republic or Cancun, but it's a decent place to lounge around and sun bathe. The music selection was a hit or miss. Some days it was hopping and popping with an actual DJ, and some days it was like they were playing a radio. The drinks are actually really overpriced, but it is Vegas, so you can't really blame them. Anywho, the crowd here was pretty laid back and it was pretty obvious that everyone was hungover. We had brought a handle of Jameson down with us and had our own personal bar going. This goes against the rules, and the staff gave us a warning, but didn't confiscate the bottle until the second warning, when the bottle was already finished. We had forgotten our swimming wear back in the room, and made the executive decision to jump into the pool in our boxers. We weren't escorted out of the pool area, so i'm assuming this is okay if anyone considers this in the future.\n\nThe tables here are cursed, and do not pay out. Go somewhere else. No, but seriously, I had the worst luck on the tables. The cocktail waitresses returned fairly quickly with the water down drinks, and do not return to you if you don't tip them well. \n\nThe restauraunt selection here isn't the best. They have one place here open 24 hours that serves food that any late night diner would. We ate here a couple early mornings, and the food is as good as any drunk person looking for a quick bite would expect. The staff at the said restaurant were a hit and miss. Some were cooperative while others gave us the evil eye. My buddy and I came here one morning after a night of painting the town red, and we actually fell asleep after we ordered our food. After miserably failing to wake us up, the staff stored our food away until we woke up. No, they didn't remake our food, but instead saved it for us. I would've said something to them about giving us food that was not fresh, but during my sleep, I actually lost my phone and one of the employees here found my phone on the floor and returned it to me once I woke up. A truly sincere gesture when in Sin City. The food wasn't that good by the way.\n\nI felt bad for the maid that was in charge of cleaning our room. The pad looked like a tornado flew through it. After the second day I started tipping any houskeeper that passed by our room and showering them with compliments. It was the least I could do. Our room was always clean after we returned from the daily escapades, with the linen being fully stocked and our bathroom presentably clean. Nothing was stolen or taken either. \n\nWe ordered room service to go along with our pregame on one of the nights when we were getting ready. Aside from the aggressive lady that yelled at us because we took to long to order, the food was extroadinary. We ordered a bunch of finger food that cost us an arm and leg, but everyone was neatly wrapped and to my surprise, well prepared and cooked. \n\nLast but not least, the people in charge of customer service. We had initially asked for a room with a view of the strip, but we also really wanted a smoking room to hot box, but to our dismay, the only smoking room they had, did not have a strip view. So we ended up settling for the view of the not so infamous Trump Tower. My buddy who had initially booked the room, called customer service intoxicated, mind you. He complained to them about the hotel view we had and gave them a bogus story about how he was going to propose tomorrow night and needed a strip view. After speaking to many people he finally had a word with the manager who actually gave us a brand new penthouse with a strip view for our last day there. These people really made our trip memorable and cooperated with all our needs. \n\nI'm giving this place 4 stars because their are better places to stay at on the strip, but if you're not really trying to go all, this is not a bad hotel. It's also right next to the Wynn and Palazzo.
