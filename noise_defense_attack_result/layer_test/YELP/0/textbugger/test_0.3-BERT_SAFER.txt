Asian buffets scare me... I usually don't know what half the stuff is, and if I do know what it is, it's a microwaved crazy sauced version of what I'm used to. Granted, I came here with a hungry hoard of UCSD dragon boaters, so we were all starved from a long day of paddling.

Just showed up to Phoenix with a buddy looking for a place to hang out that resembled the fabled Mort's Martini Bar of Wichita, Kansas.  I'm going to be residing here for a while, so I needed a place I could call home.  Magnums is quite a good location, and while it's no Mort's, it is definitely a place I could find myself [[quite]] often.\n\nFirstly, let me tell you, finding a place where you can enjoy your cigar and a beverage at the same time is exceedingly hard to do in this modern day of social awareness and health babysitting.  [[If]] you [[show]] up at a cigar bar, you should be able to enjoy it there.  \n\nWe found this [[place]] relatively [[easily]].  It's in a strip mall, but the interior is very comfortable.  The decor [[instantly]] made me feel welcome and at home.  The staff was welcoming as well.  [[They]] made sure to greet us as we walked in the door, and the humidor is large.  [[The]] only downside is on the [[day]] we visited a majority of our favorites had been purchased by like minded patrons.  The exterior of the place does not meet the [[interior]].  (Insert Doctor Who \""It's [[bigger]] on the inside\"" reference.\[[n]]\nThe staff made some excellent suggestions on local brews, and if we wanted to, we could try out many of the [[beverages]] to see if we [[liked]] it before we bought it.  The selection of their [[beers]] and beverages was [[extensive]].  \n\nSecondly, I cannot emphasize the importance for any business to focus on customer service.  [[The]] staff here had it down.  While it was a bit slow for a Friday night, the staff was eager to help, taking the opportunity to focus on the customers.  I've been to many a bar where it's a slow night and the bar [[staff]] is too busy goofing off to [[pay]] attention to you.  These guys were professional.\n\nThirdly, if you find yourself stranded in the beautiful deserts of [[Arizona]], make sure and visit this place.  It's worth your [[time]].  [[I]] will be back, and it's earned a five [[star]] from me.  Glad to have been here!\nThirdly,

This Checkers location is new to the area having only been open a few weeks at the time of this review.  It did not take me long to get there to give it a try though I did allow for the few weeks to pass giving the staff a chance to work out any glitches to their processs.  On my first of what will likely be many visits over the foreseeable future I went with my co-workers.  My boss ordered a BLT and the Baconzilla Fries.  The fries did not last long as she went hog wild on the cheesey bacon topped goodness.  The BLT, however, is still waiting for her.  Not because it is bad but because the fries were so [[good]] and so filling.  A different co-worker ordered the heart attack special with a side of all around good badness.  She got the Bacon Roadhouse Burger hold the BBQ sauce, a small order of seasoned fries and the Monsterella Cheese Sticks (fried mozarella).  It all looked great and she gave me the two thumbs up sign when I asked how she enjoyed it all.  That is a definitive win from her.  As for me, I ordered the double fish sandwich.  Think about a double Filet-O-Fish from McDonalds and add shredded lettuce.  It was about like that but by the time I got back to the office the fish had gone soggy and lost its crispy integrity.  I'll take McDonalds for the win on this one.  Besides, not much beats the bun McDonalds uses for their fish sandwich.  Anyhow, I also ordered the Fully Loaded Fries.  They are topped with melty cheese, ranch dressing and bacon bits (real bacon).  I ate about half before getting interrupted with work stuff so I set them aside and finished them the next day.  I liked the fries but they were very salty from being seasoned fries topped with cheese and bacon.  It was a little much but to at least have tried them I am happy.  Next time I go I may try either a chicken sandwich of some sort or perhaps one of the many burgers Checkers has to offer.  I would also try the cheese sticks.  They looked amazing and when dipped in marinara they must taste as good as they look.  I would also like to try some of the dessert options in the future.  They have some unique ice cream treats that sound incredible.  This food may not be good for the body but fast food rarely is.  This is food good for the mind.  You can't help but be happy at a place that serves up as much bacon as Checkers does.

Now I [[know]] why.\nWe ate at the [[Las]] Vegas-Fremont [[location]] on 8/28 for dinner only because we were [[invited]] by our friends that LOVE this restaurant and make it a tradition to go here when they visit Las Vegas.  There were eight of us.  It was about 5:30 and not crowded.  We were seated in a few minutes.\nService was fair.  [[Server]] was courteous and efficient.\nI ordered the Baby Back [[Ribs]] Tony Roma size at $19.  Got cole slaw and a baked potato.\nI asked for spicy sauce.\nThe ribs were below [[average]] and not very [[meaty]], sauce was not spicy at all.  Baked potato and cole slaw was fair.\nWe were given some bread.  It was [[dry]].  The butter they offer is not butter but very [[small]] \""Promise\""  margarine containers in a basket!  Are you kidding?  It took me about five containers for my baked [[potato]] and two for my [[roll]].\nButter should be on the plate in a [[container]] with the sour cream([[got]] this).  Margarine should be an option for those that don't use [[butter]].\n\nIn summary, Tony Roma's is a below average [[overpriced]] restaurant.  There are many other restaurants in this city.  Don't waste your time.

NISHisHOT doesn't take shit from NOBODY.\n\nNO body.\n\nEspecially at restaurants.\n\nSo if you want to offer a ginger infused lychee martini.  And it tastes like the vodka that comes straight out of my freezer.  Well . . . \n\nIt SUCKS.  It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen. \n\nAnd if you want to offer Mackerel on your sushi menu that's as stale as the Talk Threads on Yelp.  Well . . . \n\nIt's UNACCEPTABLE.  It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen.\n\nBut if you offer. . . tiradito and lobster and oysters and sashimi and black cod and lions and tigers and a baby gorilla (it's Vegas, baby.

A couple mishaps that got sent back to the kitchen and off the check.   But the other food more than made up for it.  Including the baby gorilla.  And the excellent, good looking service.\n\nAnd about that check.  Well.  Shocking.  Stabbing.  No that's not my heart.  It's my wallet exploding.\n\nSo  . . . 5 Stars to my boyfriend for always knowing that I'm always better at being a drama mamma than ever paying for dinner.  \n\n(Okay!

My family and I were in town for my nieces college graduation. The waitress at Joes Crab Shack told us to try Poppys because it was last call at Joes (that's how we roll). Being responsible and not driving intoxicated we walked down and was not disappointed. Fran was very accommodating to our party and even opened the kitchen up for our late night munchies. We were introduced to Poppys Punch which I highly recommend and it was nice to hang out on the patio. We had a great time and intend to drop in again when we're in the area.

The waiter (Carl) was nice and did come around a few times to ask if everything tasted ok. After we were completely done eating, still no manager. Carl came to the table and stated the kitchen was \""backed up and having issues\"" he then stated the assistant manager was the only one working that day and he/she couldn't step out as he/she was assisting the kitchen in getting back on track. He then stated he was able to [[comp]] us ($11.00) and apologized for the [[service]]. \n\nAs we knew it was not the waiter's fault, we were extremely disappointed in the hour wait, no silverware, and no manager after requesting he/she twice. The cherry on top was the fact that the assistant manager essentially could not come out for a few minutes to speak with a dissatisfied customer. Extremely unprofessional.

As an [[avid]] coffee fan, I have to [[say]] that [[Caribou]] has won me over. They have free Wi-Fi, which is great if you find yourself in the [[area]] and you need to do some [[work]] [[via]] computer. When you walk in the door, you feel like you've left the Southside and [[entered]] a cozy ski lodge. They even have a [[fireplace]] surrounded by big, comfy chairs -definitely a [[plus]] when you're [[looking]] for a place to relax and [[sip]] on some [[espresso]]. \n\nOne of the [[cool]] things about Caribou is that it has a wider variety of menu [[items]] than your typical coffee shop. The [[oatmeal]] (try their Blueberry [[Almond]] flavor, so [[good]]!), breakfast sandwiches and snacks are [[much]] [[better]] than what you can [[get]] at your local Starbucks. [[If]] you're not a coffee [[person]], Caribou also has some really [[good]] [[flavored]] teas. [[Overall]], a [[great]] place to get your caffeine fix.

I went to this venue for the Carnivore's tour last month and was really pleased with my experience again. This time when I went, we were in a slightly different section and the lighting was WAY better. The line of sight to the show was great, and although I'd prefer to be closer to the stage, it was a great experience. Awesome show, great accommodations.

I was at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort for a conference and I had paid for a booth in the Hohokam Ballroom for three days. During my stay my boothmate and I began receiving huge red itchy welts which were bug bites from insects in the ballroom. I went to the concierge who took me into the business center to speak with the manager Kyle King, who apologized and said he would immediately come down to the ballroom to assess the situation. Unfortunately nobody ever came to deal with the insect problem and we continued to receive bites and ended up with around a dozen bites each from our feet up to our knees. The bites were so itchy that they kept us both up at night for a week even while constantly applying medication. I later spoke with a nurse who said that they appeared to be flea bites and that the hotel needed to take action with the problem since flea bites can become infected from the feces fleas leave while on our skin and if they are scratched can lead to scarring.\n\nAfter the event, I called the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort and asked to speak to a manager about this issue. Nobody would connect me to a manager and asked why I needed to speak to a manager in the first place. I explained what had happened during my stay on the property and was told they would find the manager Kyle King I had spoken with and connect me to him. I was put on hold for more than ten minutes and then was told I was going to be connected to the Director of Security, who told me he would get Kyle King's contact information and call me back with that information so I could e-mail photographs of the bug bites I received from my stay on the property. The Director of Security called me back and said his boss wouldn't allow him to give me a managers contact information.\n\nAfter this I e-mailed the resort and was told that since I didn't pay to stay in a hotel room and only paid to stay in the Hohokam Ballroom that they couldn't do anything about it even though this happened on their property and they did nothing about it. And speaking of rooms, I later was informed that some individuals that stayed in hotel rooms on the property during the same time had issues with ants swarming in their rooms which ended up getting into their luggage.\n\nOverall I think it is ridiculous that the hotel wouldn't do anything about the bugs and also that nobody would let me speak to a manager when I had a complaint. I expected a clean and safe environment to be in at the resort, but the resort has bug problems in several different areas which need to be attended to for the safety and health of the guests.

I can't say enough about one hairstylist in particular. Julia is the ONLY one in Scottsdale who I trust to touch my lovely long locks. I've followed her from her previous Salon for 2 years. She listens to what I want, but also contributes suggestions. She is a color genius, creating stunning dimension that can be subtle for a less noticeable grow-out over time, or dramatic and bold. She is meticulous, and proud of her work. She also makes the time fly by making conversation and overall treating you like you're talking to a friend you've known for years. Overall time in the chair is a little long, but I'm willing to spend a few extra hours to walk out feeling like doing a Beyonce hair flip!

Completely awful. \n\nThe scheduling was all messed up and they forced us to start early, which I am not holding against them in this review. They claim to have fired the person who caused this error.\n\nWe had a 1600 sq. ft. condo and just two people worth of stuff; no kids. Everything was already boxed, including the garage. Just move the boxes and the furniture to the truck, drive the truck from point A to point B, and unload the truck.\n\nThe first crew that arrived just after 11:00 and did nothing but load 2/3 of the garage for the first hour and a half while they \""waited for a second truck\"" because apparently we have too much stuff to fit in just one. I still got charged for this time. After 5 hours total at our old house, the moving company claimed they wanted to send a second crew of two guys out to make sure that the original two guys finished before 20:00. Now I have to pay for two crews worth of time. The second crew arrived and helped finish the master bedroom and we were finally loaded and moved on to the new house.\n\nAt the new house, all four guys took another 3 hours to unload all the furniture and put it in the proper rooms.\n\nThe wife was quite hungry and left for the new house ahead of me leaving the old house, and she got pizza for us and another for the movers. When we arrived at the new house, the movers spent 45 minutes eating pizza and standing around our kitchen talking about football. I didn't say anything at the time because I was hungry and eating as well, and I expected they wouldn't charge me for this time. WRONG. They charged me for the nearly full hour they spent eating my food. \n\nAfter over 8 full hours, three trucks (two of them 2/3 full and one completely empty) and two moving crews billed separately at the moving company's request we were finally moved. There was no damage done to any of our gear, and the movers themselves were quite pleasant. My biggest problem is that they moved slow and seemed to not care about time at the same time they were billing hourly. This is completely unacceptable. \n\nThe only issue I had with their treatment of my furniture is that they didn't care which way was right side up. They said we could leave our drawers full and they would just shrink-wrap them and move them in place, so that's exactly what we did. However because they were constantly moving them on edge or upside-down, all the things in the drawers ended up out of the drawers, so we had to physically remove the drawers, pick up all the jumbled contents of the drawers from the interior floor of the dresser, put the drawers back, and replace the contents of the drawers. This is worse than boxing it up and leaving the drawers empty!\n\nI moved into this house in just over 3 hours for just under $400 with 2 movers. There is zero reason that four men took roughly 8 hours and cost more than 4\u00d7 the price. A friend of ours moved a 3800 sq. ft. house full of furniture with this company in less time, for less money, and with a single crew of 2! \n\nI can not recommend against this company enough, regardless of how pleasant the actual movers were to deal with.

Very attentive and helpful.  W had the Brunch that included a cream filled crepe with berry puree, eggs provencale, and beautiful croissant.

Gather around little Yelpers, let me tell you about my stay at ye ol' Treasure Island. [[No]], but seriously get ready to hear it.\n\nWe had the penthouse [[suite]] here. Our room was beautifully decorated and looked real crisp. Being an all guys birthday weeknd, we wanted to go all out. As soon as entering the room, we immediately fired up the jacuzzi. And 10 minutes later there was [[water]] all over the floor due to my fellow comrade who thinks it's not a problem to cannonball indoors. The staff handled the situation pretty well actually. They hand soaked and air dryed the room while we were out and the room looked [[handy]] dandy when we returned that night.\n\nBeing a fairly rowdy group, being loud was a given. Things got a little wierd for us two days in. Our room was the first room on the hall we were in, and they actually had a person standing by our room 24/7. I asked why was this necessary, but the staff all told me they were doing what they were told by the relief and higher class. I'm conviced they were keeping an eye on us.\nThe pool area was exceptional. I mean, it's not a Wet Republic or Cancun, but it's a decent place to lounge around and sun bathe. The music selection was a hit or miss. [[Some]] days it was hopping and popping with an actual DJ, and some days it was like they were playing a radio. The drinks are actually really overpriced, but it is Vegas, so you can't really blame them. Anywho, the crowd here was pretty laid back and it was pretty obvious that everyone was hungover. We had brought a handle of Jameson down with us and had our own personal bar going. This goes against the rules, and the staff gave us a warning, but didn't confiscate the bottle until the second warning, when the bottle was already finished. We had forgotten our swimming wear back in the room, and made the executive decision to jump into the pool in our boxers. We weren't escorted out of the pool area, so i'm assuming this is okay if anyone considers this in the future.\n\nThe tables here are cursed, and do not pay out. Go somewhere else. No, but seriously, I had the worst luck on the tables. The cocktail waitresses returned fairly quickly with the water down drinks, and do not return to you if you don't tip them well. \n\nThe restauraunt selection here isn't the best. They have one place here open 24 hours that serves food that any late night diner would. We ate here a couple early mornings, and the food is as [[good]] as any drunk person looking for a quick [[bite]] would expect. The staff at the said restaurant were a hit and miss. Some were cooperative while others gave us the evil eye. My buddy and I came here one morning after a night of painting the town red, and we actually fell asleep after we ordered our food. After miserably failing to wake us up, the staff stored our food away until we woke up. No, they didn't remake our food, but instead saved it for us. I would've said something to them about giving us food that was not fresh, but during my sleep, I actually lost my phone and one of the employees here found my phone on the floor and returned it to me once I woke up. A truly sincere gesture when in Sin City. The food wasn't that good by the way.\n\nI felt bad for the maid that was in charge of cleaning our room. The pad looked like a tornado flew through it. After the second day I started tipping any houskeeper that passed by our room and showering them with compliments. It was the least I could do. Our room was always clean after we returned from the daily escapades, with the linen being fully stocked and our bathroom presentably clean. Nothing was stolen or taken either. \n\nWe ordered room service to go along with our pregame on one of the nights when we were getting ready. Aside from the aggressive lady that yelled at us because we took to long to order, the food was extroadinary. We ordered a bunch of finger food that cost us an arm and leg, but everyone was neatly wrapped and to my surprise, well prepared and cooked. \n\nLast but not least, the people in charge of customer service. We had initially asked for a room with a view of the strip, but we also really wanted a smoking room to hot box, but to our dismay, the only smoking room they had, did not have a strip view. So we ended up settling for the view of the not so infamous Trump Tower. My buddy who had initially booked the room, called customer service [[intoxicated]], mind you. He complained to them about the hotel view we had and gave them a bogus story about how he was going to propose tomorrow night and needed a strip view. After speaking to many people he finally had a word with the manager who actually gave us a brand new penthouse with a strip view for our last day there. These people really made our trip memorable and cooperated with all our needs. \n\nI'm giving this place 4 stars because their are better places to stay at on the strip, but if you're not really trying to go all, this is not a bad hotel. It's also right next to the Wynn and Palazzo.

Thanks to Anita for reminding me how awful this mall is!  I rarely meet a that I cannot find some reason to like.  When it comes to this one, I say just pass it up.  With so much fabulous shopping to be had at The Fashion Show Mall, The Forum Shops and even The Bellagio's shopping area, you could skip this and go to a spa instead!  She is right about the enormous crowds of people here.  The walk ways are pretty narrow which makes things worse.  The stores are the worst of the worst and the people working in them are miserable.  Ooh, I just thought of one thing I could like here.....there is a restaurant owned by IL Fornaio called \""Canaletto\"".  We ate here once and it was pretty good.

Drove into Pittsburgh really late at night. So late the city had pretty much shut up shop. Walked around Station Square for literally an hour passing this place three times before finally having lost all sense of reason and succumbed to the kitsch seafood [[decor]], flying shark with mardi-gras beads in its mouth and party lights. I am allergic to crab but thought hey you only live once right?! and ordered the lobster and king crab steam pot from the extra super buff teenage waiter whose shirt was so tight I could not understand how he could carry around a tray full of food. He was pleasant [[enough]] and although the place was practically empty he was never around when I wanted him and always around asking if I needed anything while I was stuffing my face full of sea creatures. The steampot was fine but the whole box of spices they add to it completely ruin the dish and I shudder to think they [[try]] to do that to hide how not-so-fresh the seafood is..[[ugh]]..Well I didn't have my face in a toilet or have exploding diarrhoea after or die from sea creature poisoning so there's a plus. The prices are really high for what they serve but Pittsburgh is pretty far from the ocean. On the plus side I love trains and you can sit right next to the train line and not even hear them pass every 20mins. Also the view across to the city is amazing across the river framed by the monumental massive amount of bridges and you are literally steps from the funicular to walk off your dinner.

We had been hearing rave reviews about this pizza and yelp has the reviews to back up what we were hearing.  The staff is super friendly.  One of the best things about this pizza place is that when there is a line to be seated you can pre order your pie so when you sit down you wait for food is very short.  It is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out.\n\nOn to the food.  Started with the 1/2 and 1/2 dinner salad.  The Italian dressing was just ok for me, but there was nothing wrong with it.  The 1/2 of spinach was [[non]] existent.  The pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed.  My biggest complaint about the pie was the sweet sauce.  So sweet in fact that I had to add salt to try to cut the sweetness.  Defiantly not my favorite pie.

One of the best things about this pizza place is that when there is a line to be seated you can pre order your pie so when you sit down you wait for food is very short.  It is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out.\n\nOn to the food.  Started with the 1/2 and 1/2 dinner salad.  The Italian dressing was just ok for me, but there was nothing wrong with it.  The 1/2 of spinach was [[ni]] existent.  The pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed.  My biggest complaint about the pie was the sweet sauce.  So sweet in fact that I had to add salt to try to cut the sweetness.  Defiantly not my favorite pie.

OMG, are their ANY competent fast food places anymore? Two customers in the restaurant around 3pm'ish and THREE people behind the front counter with 4 more in the back kitchen area. No lie, it took these guys almost 9 minutes to put 10 pcs of chicken in a bucket and hand it to me! With my to-go order, no condiments, utensils, plates, napkins...nothing. And they want to raise the minimum wage??? Really?

Linda is AMAZING, not only is she an amazing person but she is also awesome at scar revisions.  I have a dog bite scar from 1996 that went all the way to the bone that I am self-conscious about.  I saw a crazy deal on Living Social for [[skin]] needling, WHAT??? I had no idea what that even was but after talking to Linda on the phone for 20 minutes I felt confident that she could help, at least, make the scar less noticeable. She never made promises that I felt like she could not keep, as in, she said it would be invisible or it would disappear, etc.  We are talking about a deep, old scar.  However, my scar looks AMAZING after 4 [[treatments]].  [[It]] is flat, smaller and the discoloration is on the way to being gone.  I am beyond [[impressed]] with how it looks. I AM [[THRILLED]]!

My skin looks and feels amazing.  I have not ever been this happy with how my skin looks and feels.  I have less wrinkles, less middle age acne break outs and the texture of my skin is amazing.  \nLinda never over sells products or pushes things on you, so you never feel like you \""have to [[buy]] what she uses on you\"" like you do at some salons you visit.  She is one of the most genuine people you will ever meet and she will be honest about what she can and can not do to help you.  I really appreciated that when we started working on my scar.

We also got a free pass to Marquee and even have special hotel guess line! Score!! We were let in first just because we were staying there. We were told, though that this free pass was only because of the labor day weekend and it was only that Friday! We had terrific time there.

The food and menu were very [[good]]. Decent portions but not overwhelmingly large. Definitely not your average restaurant. There are only a few tables, most of the seating is at four 25 foot long tables. Also no menu's, everything is written in chalk up on the wall which I personally didn't care for but it was original...kinda. Anyway I will return. Service was good, parking was easy. Good place to go.

We were really hoping this would be a great place.  It may be, but unfortunately, they forgot our order and we sat in a mostly empty restaurant for about 45 minutes wondering what happened to our sandwiches.  Ended up leaving hungry because we couldn't stay any longer.  They did credit us back for the entire meal, so that was good.  Maybe we'll try again??

Went back to North on Saturday night.  Have not been there for a few years.  I stopped going since the quality of the food did not match the pricing.   It was good but not spectacular.  Atmosphere is always great and full of energy.  \n\nMuch better experience this time around.  We started with the calamari appetizer.  Calamari were tender and tasty, however, there were not enough to my liking and presentation was not very good.  Calamari were in pieces or broken.  At this type of restaurant I would expect nice round calamari rings embedded in the tender arugula served with the calamari.\n\nThe entrees were much better.  I had the braised beef short rib gnocchi with horseradish cream.  Excellent dish.  Very flavorful and gnocchi were al dente.  Beef was melt in your mouth tender. Dish was  definitely on the rich side, but worth it.  My wife decided on the salmon.  Perfectly cooked to her liking.  The creamy farro side was outstanding, almost like a risotto.\n\nService was very good.  Waiter was very busy, but was efficient and attentive.

Contrary to a lot of Yelper's reviews, I wasn't that impressed with Blue Dust. It's a hole in the wall with a fantastic beer selection. \n\nIt's off the beaten path of the waterfront, located across the tracks towards Eighth Ave. next to a tattoo parlor on Amity Street. \n\nI'd heard a lot about this place as well as read just about every review on Yelp and newspaper reviews. I wasn't sure what to expect, but a dark, dank, Burgh bar wasn't it. \n\nI was highly impressed with the bar, any brand of vodka, flavored, proof, etc, bacon bourbon, and a nice selection of beers. I had a black IPA, which was awesome with the Spicy China Doll (a thick pasty bean dip that could have used a bit of salt) served with very good tortilla chips that's weren't a bit greasy. For Dinner I had a portobello wrap, it was nice and meaty but lacked basic salt and pepper seasoning.  Neither the app or wrap really stood out in my mind. \n\nIf this was the last restaurant on earth, I'd come back, by then maybe they'll know how to properly season food before being consumed by their customers.

I love Taza Flores! The place looks good and the terrace is very pleasant in the summer. The service is very friendly and attentive. And everything on the menu is really really good. I've been going for years and it never fails. My favorite are the lamb tajine, the chorizo, the eggplant pizza and the mergez in tomato sauce. It is a bit expensive for the size of the portions, but they put love into it.

I was excited about having a NY og with the red onions I love so much. I don't know why they (and other hot dog shops) cant use the standard bun instead the fancy ones that are just too much bread. Anyway, if you order, ask them to hold the mustard so you can apply it yourself. They flooded mine with mustard and killed any chanve of enjoying the onions.

They gave us great customer service when we called. It sounded so awesome that even my brother and his family wanted to go! They asked if I can call and book one more room.\n\nSo I called and asked to try and see if we can book one more double-bed room. They said they were more than happy to book one more double-bed room!

I'll pay it but I am not happy that I was misled to begin with. I want to talk to the girl who gave me the wrong information or her supervisor to file a complaint. If I hadn't called back and added the additional room I would have showed up with 8 adults and 1 infant with two beds only?\n\nWell, nobody ever called me back. Whatever.

I've been frequenting Panera Bread locations around Vegas for YEARS. In my opinion, this location stands out as the cleanest and most consistently delicious with the most friendly staff! The staff are always smiling and eager to take your order, speaking to you like you're an old friend! \n\nI stopped in here this morning to grab a quick bagel and coffee before work. I rarely eat bagels, but have been craving one for weeks. I ordered Asiago Cheese, toasted, with cream cheese and a large coffee. Coffee is self serve (unless you order a latte) and I really enjoy their Hazelnut brew! I also ordered a pumpkin spice latte for my girlfriend. \n\nBagels were ready in just a few minutes and always taste fresh and delicious. My only complaint is that the cream cheese comes in a small container and you have to put it on your bagel yourself. This is a bit inconvenient for me as I prefer the grab and go style quickie breakfast. \n\nWhen I drop in for a quick lunch/dinner, I always go for the \""you pick two\"" option because I can never decide between soup or sandwich/panini. I don't think I've ever not enjoyed a sandwich from here. Everything is always made fresh with quality ingredients (meats, cheese, veggies). Also, you CANNOT go wrong w/ the broccoli cheese soup - yummy!!!!\n\nALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS order a side of french baguette. Trust me, it tastes like heaven!

Seriously?  Who likes this chain bs quality crap?\n\nI like myself a badass sandwich.  This place DOES NOT have it.\n\nInadequate portions, inadequate food, un-personable service and tacky typical \""bread/bakery co\"" atmosphere.  I've now been over 5 times since i moved here 4 months ago, and not one visit has been satisfactory or fulfilling.  I'm going to wildflower with better portions and flavor or taking a trip to pane bianco.  \n\nDont waste your taste buds.

Hey there goes Louis Vuitton! Ooooh, Prada! Hello there, Gucci! Wait a minute, aren't there like several other locations of these stores within a 3 mile radius of this place? \n\nThere's not really a single accessible store or restaurant in here, and to make it [[worse]], many of the stores in this \""new\"" mall have already existed on The Strip for more than 10 years. With how hard they were trying to make this place \""different\"" you would think they would have brought in something new to the table. For what it's worth, there are some very interesting architectural details and public artwork within this mall worth seeing at least once (I really liked the glowing trees, okay they weren't exactly glowing but I'm not sure how else to describe them), but that doesn't make me any more interested in browsing at a Gucci store when I can just browse at one down the street. \n\nExcuse me while I go down to the Fashion Show or the Forum Shops, browse in the super upscale stores I can't afford but can still manage to buy something at a more reasonable store anyway. At least those two malls don't completely reek of pretension and feel closer to the real world if you know what I mean.

Absolutely terrible. The overweight, ugly, disgusting 'manager' of the store - I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman - sees that my check engine and ABS lights are on because my sensor chip in my car is messed up (note: The car is just fine. I take it to a mechanic every 3 months or less), and STILL charges me $20 without even conducting the full test. In fact, she knows it's going to fail the whole time and does it anyways.  This place is a scam and this location in particular - I'm filing complaints with all of the offices, both written and verbal (ADEQ) and I hope that this location in particular is shut down and that the 'manager' (who didn't wear a name tag, which is either out of shame or the sure sign of a scam) is FIRED.\n\nPrivate functions need to replace all State functions within the next 5 years. Scottsdale, we can be first - let's kick public industry out of our city.

I will always love hopping aboard the Gateway Clipper, no matter what the event! I most recently went on a 1 hour sight seeing tour ($20) in the evening. It was a wonderful trip, sailing beneath many of Pittsburgh's famous bridges, passing the point, and even shouting out to the Pirate's fans during a game with a giant Pirate flag and a huge toot from the boat! The tour guide was very energetic and knowledgeable about Pittsburgh's history, from the movies filmed in our city to the myths and facts about Mount Washington, none of the tour was boring! I am really looking forward to attending some of the holiday cruises or a murder mystery cruise! There are many options to choose from, all of which are packed with entertainment and fun that won't leave you disappointed! As an added plus, you are free to snap away photos while on the boat, creating some fun memories and some unique Pittsburgh themed selfies!

So last January I made the mistake of staying with my friends at the Tropicana. Ok so we get the the Tropicana check in and everything is fine. Me and my wifey had our own single bedroom. So we go up to the 15th floor what luck our room is right next to the elevator which is a super plus! Little did we know that when we swiped our card through the door what was in store for us... Ok so I have to give the tropicana points for doing a great job with the remodeling it is very nice. A big downer was the room not being clean.. luckily my wifey is a neat freak so she jumped all over it. Some towels were dirty so we pushed those aside and made due. Glasses were spotty didn't even look like they were washed. There were long black hairs on the bed. Luckily we just checked in so the wifey couldn't get crazy. lol. Everything else was ok just really lame that we had to clean up before we got there. Thankfully the slot gods made my trip worth while!

Then click the Coupons link and print coupons. Most of the coupons on their site are Target Coupons so that means you can pair a Manufacturer's coupon with the Target Coupons and save extra!

Yup, it's a generous 4 [[stars]] from me, despite the grimaces that seem to appear on people's faces when I mention the place.\n\nNow there is a slight possibility that the bottle of wine I had before going out combined with the vodka and shots consumed in the club may have slightly clouded my judgement in it's favour.\n\nHowever Espionage is HUGE which is great if, like me, you like a bit of space to shake your shimmy. There are TV screens showing videos of the music being played - cue a hilarious/mortifying attempt by me and my pals to emulate Beyonce. It was busy, the people there were all really friendly (or maybe that was just me!) and out to have a good time and it's ideal if there are a group of you out to mingle.\n\nRefined it is not however, and they definately know their shots better than their cocktails.

Yup, it's a generous 4 [[notoriety]] from me, despite the grimaces that seem to appear on people's faces when I mention the place.\n\nNow there is a slight possibility that the bottle of wine I had before going out combined with the vodka and shots consumed in the club may have slightly clouded my judgement in it's favour.\n\nHowever Espionage is HUGE which is great if, like me, you like a bit of space to shake your shimmy. There are TV screens showing videos of the music being played - cue a hilarious/mortifying attempt by me and my pals to emulate Beyonce. It was busy, the people there were all really friendly (or maybe that was just me!) and out to have a good time and it's ideal if there are a group of you out to mingle.\n\nRefined it is not however, and they definately know their shots better than their cocktails.

[[We]] came here for lunch last week.  We had a coupon we had purchased online and thought we'd try this place.  The visit started off [[badly]] when we arrived at the place and there was a handwritten sign saying that \""All Groupons must have reservations\"", with a phone number listed.  So, we stood outside in the 100 degree Las Vegas heat and called for a reservation.  We were asked when we wanted to eat and my wife told them, we are standing outside and are here for lunch.  They [[told]] her the manager wasn't there and could we call a different phone number and talk to the manager?  So, we did.  [[Again]], my wife asked if we could make a \""reservation\"" and told the person on the phone that we were here for lunch.  He said is would be over in about 15 minutes.  Say what?  Not sure what his presence at the restaurant had to do with us eating [[lunch]].  My [[wife]] asked, \""Can we go inside and order\"".  Yes, you may.  Sheesh! \n\nSo, in we [[went]].  A nice lady promptly seated us as we were the only customers there as lunch time (a bad sign?).  We ordered a la carte sushi from the \""Groupon Menu\"", huh?! We were quickly given water to drink.  About 10 minutes after we ordered, a [[young]] man showed up at our table with headphones on.  [[The]] manager perhaps?  Not sure, he didn't introduce himself, but he wanted to know about our coupon.  He took the coupon.\n\nSo, after all of that, the sushi came out.  It seemed decent actually, but who wants to go through all of that to order a few sushi rolls?  This place will likely close within a couple of months due to bad reputation and no business.\n\nI feel bad for the waitress as she seemed nice and polite.\n\nI definitely would not come back.

We left LA at 1:30pm didn't get there until 7pm. Terrible traffic on the 15, you think that leaving at 1pm one would avoid traffic. We came here to attend EDC (Electrical Daisy Carnival). Us guys shared the room it was $420 per night so it didn't come cheap. \n\nMarquee pool party was the best everybody was chilled and fun. The only casual fast food available were Pizza, Chinese, and Mexican place. If you wanted wonton noodle soup you won't get it here. I think the Chinese place only offer four items, a few dim sum items.Clearly Cosmo doesn't want to highlight \""food court\"" area. We did run into a few celeb which was cool since I'm a bit a of a sports fan. We saw Cam Newton. Russell Westbrook walked into my elevator and I recited his average game stats. He was impressed. On the way back from EDC we ran into Gus Hanson and we waved hello to him. We met many cool people and laugh the entire time.\n\nThe only place open 24 hours was \""The Henry\"" we went both nights. I ordered braised short ribs with Hollandaise sauce. It came with a demiglace sauce... borlandaise sauce? It was overly reduced and too salty.  \n\nHotel was loud so this is not for a quite couple, but if you're sassy and roll with deep pocket you'll have tons of fun. \n\n\""How do you know when you're in Vegas?

I liked the decor and atmosphere a lot.  It was loud, but lively and warm. We didn't have a reservation, so we got seated in what turned out to be not such a [[great]] table.  It was really close to the bar.  Our server-- who was very nice and clearly well-trained-- tried to make some room, but we just sat on the same side.  \n\n\nCocktails were fine.  You can tell they're trying hard, but the results were [[nothing]] to write home about.\n\nCheese curds were good-- I would say above average, with a nice light batter.\n\nMy wife ordered scallops, which were served with swiss chard and some nice crusty bread ($26).  This included three scallops (medium-large, but not enormous).  [[The]] sauce really added nothing to them.  [[Not]] a bad dish, but really kind of [[bland]] and boring.  My wife thought that they were tasty but overpowered by salt.  I thought that they were just boring.\n\nI had the pappardelle ($19).  To be honest, it [[kind]] of sucked.  The proportions were off (oddly enough, not enough pasta and too much sauce) and the sausage that they were using seemed to be high-quality, but ill suited for the dish.  It was bland when it needed to be robust.  It came with what seemed to be  a huge ball of ricotta, but it [[seemed]] to just melt in and away quickly, adding very little to the dish.  On the whole, this dish  really could have used some more flavor, if even just some more salt.  \n\nSo, in sum, an utterly mediocre and forgettable meal for far too much money (total with three drinks and tip was just under $100).\n\nI highly doubt we'll be back.

As per our custom, we sampled eachother's foods and couldn't decide which one we liked better. I also enjoyed a (reasonably priced) Thai tea with my meal.

I bought a Groupon to go [[try]] Mabuhay Philippine Cuisine, and The Wife and I finally went to [[use]] it for dinner this past Saturday. We had heard good-ish reviews for Mabuhay, and were [[excited]] to try a new style of food. Unfortunately, the [[whole]] experience, from start to finish, ended up being [[terrible]], which led us to give the restaurant the nickname of \""Mabu-bye.\"" We actually [[walked]] out of the restaurant before we had even taken a single bite of food, but, lest you think I'm being unfair in this review, [[please]] read the whole thing.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a small strip [[mall]] along S Park Street, which wasn't a big deal to us because some of our favorite [[restaurants]] have been located in strip malls. Our first warning of things to come should have been that there was only one other car parked in the lot at 6:00 pm on a Saturday evening, but we walked in [[anyway]]. [[Upon]] [[entering]] the restaurant, we [[discovered]] that there was no one at the cash register, and no indication of whether to seat ourselves or wait for someone to seat us. We saw one waiter running around getting drinks for the 3 tables that were eating, but he never once looked at us. After standing awkwardly in the entrance for a few minutes, we decided to just sit down at a table, at which point a woman who had been sitting and eating at one of the other tables got up and said, \""Yes, wherever you want.\"" Well, that would've been helpful a few minutes ago!\n\nSo, we sat down at a table, and the waiter came over another few minutes later to [[ask]] if we wanted drinks. Both [[The]] Wife and I ordered water, which he brought out, but  it was lukewarm (no ice at all) and the glasses were barely 3/4 full. He then walked away without saying a word about ordering food.\n\nNow, going in, we knew that the food would be served buffet style, but the waiter did not say whether we could just go up to the buffet or whether he would bring us plates to use first. So, I got up and went to look at the buffet. I discovered a stack of maybe 6 plates that I thought were clean (though I'm still not sure they were), some silverware, and [[one]] bowl. I also glanced at the buffet items, and thought, \""Oh, god, what have we gotten into?\"" The Wife came up to join me at the buffet, and while she was looking over the [[options]], I started to serve myself some rice. [[I]] dug the rice scoop into the rice cooker only to discover that the rice was so overcooked that it was too hard to push the scoop into. So, I changed my mind about the rice and went to look more closely at the other food options.\n\nNone of the dishes were labeled, so it was a complete guessing game as to what food you might be serving yourself. The stuff that looked like chicken skewers were just sitting in a metal tray perched precariously on the edge of the buffet station, but they looked old and dry. One of the pasta dishes looked so slimy that it literally made me gag, and the other noodle dish looked old and crunchy, which is not how I ever want to eat noodles. The remainder of the dishes looked funky, old (like they had been sitting out for a while), and, again, we had absolutely no idea what any of them actually were.\n\nGiven how terrible EVERYTHING looked and how bad our initial service experience had been, we set our plates back on the table, left $1 to tip for the [[water]], and walked out. I wish I hadn't wasted money on the Groupon to this place, but that sunk cost was minimal compared with our desire to just say, \""Mabu-bye\"" to this disgusting restaurant.

At 1 PM, we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices. Only one seafood entree (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.  \n\nEntrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a nice surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly [[forgettable]]. My fish had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.  \n\nIt's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.  Service seemed friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt. \n\nJudging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back. Two stars for the ceviche.

I went to Professional Brake when my was having a hard time running and my towing would not tow to my normal place because it was to far away. On the way to the shop the tow truck driver warned me about this place, stating that he had heard many horror stories about it. This put me on edge but I was willing to try it out.\n\nI walked in and Jeff was very friendly. There was a guest sitting there waiting for his car. We started talking and he mentioned how these guys had ripped him off in the past and how he felt it was happening again because he came in for an easy fix that turned out to not be an easy fix. So when they started looking at my car I made sure I was watching what they were doing.\n\nThey quickly found the problem and started looking for the part. They spent a lot of time calling around to try and find the part, finally they found it and gave me a quote. I was satisfied with this and mentioned that my headlights were out and I would like them to be replaced. I left and came back an hour later to get my car.\n\nJeff [[informed]] me that my headlights were out because of a major electrical issue and he was going to charge me an extra $30 finders fee for the part for my car. This surprised me because he quoted me after they found the part, the fee should have already been in the quote. I paid and left.\n\nThe next day I took it to my normal place (see my other reviews) and had them double check all of their work and look into the headlights. Their work was sound, but there was nothing wrong with my electrical, my headlights were just out.\n\nIn conclusion: if you decide to go here make sure you keep an eye on your car and if they say that there is an issue that you are unsure of, get a second opinion!

Great little store offering sweets and lots of nostalgia.  Fun shop to pop into.  I found candy (such as salt water taffy and googoo clusters) from my childhood, sweets from the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, even regular \""staples\"" such as Sweet tarts and MaryJanes. \nThey also sell novelty items such as tin signs, pez dispensers and metal lunchboxes.  There is also a nice variety of sugar-free confections.  Prices range from fair to somewhat pricey, but if you're aching to find a sweet that sparks a memory---this is the right spot!  \n\nLocated near UltraStar Theatre, so great spot to pop in and grab something before a movie or to peek in and satisfy that sweet tooth!

Today was my first time in the store and I was truly [[impressed]] with how professional and [[knowledgeable]] [[Scott]] was the entire time. As you would expect when you walk into one of the [[specialty]] stores for running shoes (Berkeley Running, Fleet Feet and the likes), Scott started off by asking me about my running frequency, distances, goals etc. Next he had me do a test run on a treadmill to determine pronation and a foot scan to look at my arches and weight distribution. He would explain the results to you so you gain a little more understanding into your own unique running style. \n\nNext he would bring out 4 - 5 pairs of shoes he thinks would fit you best. And he has a pretty good idea of what would be a good fit. My second pair of shoes fit like a glove. The staff there are very patient, staying with you as long as it takes for you to find your fit. If your first impression is anything less than perfect, they would discourage you from continuing, and give you another pair. Really [[awesome]] level of customer service. \n\nOnce you have found your match, you hop back onto the treadmill for another test run. Just to make sure that [[everything]] is still as [[great]] as it started out to be!! They were out of the shoes in the color I wanted, but Scott placed an order for me from the warehouse instead of pushing me to get it in another color which was in stock. \n\nAs you can probably sense by now I am super impressed and happy with what I got. I would recommend this store for running, swimming and biking needs. You will walk away with merchandize that will truly help your goals positively. As in other running stores around town they do offer discounts for various affiliations so just ask the friendly staff.

Maybe it's just me but this store is not up to par in my opinion. I always stop here to get money orders for rent on the way home from work and I almost always have to wait at the counter for 5 or more minutes while employees constantly yell \""someone will be right with you\"" at me from all directions. The sandwich counter is good although it says sandwich in 3 minutes or its free and it always takes longer. (I never say anything because I don't care, I just don't see the point of the sign.) Their meat section is a joke lacking any real selection. The produce is almost always below my quality standards and is also lacking in selection. Last but most definitely not least they always have just one register open and no self checkout. Overall going there is a highly inconveniencing experience and I would not recommend going there for anything.

Lovey love love this boutique. Finally checked it out on a First Friday, of all nights, even though I regularly stop at Roosevelt right next door. \nThe clothes are incredibly cute but just too expensive for me to justify buying. Not like Urban Outfitters expensive and cute though - at least this stuff is unique and good quality, so if I had an extra $90 lying around, I would totally buy myself a sweater or shirt or that darling pea green corduroy a-line skirt with the swallow patch. I love the dresses, but a hundy on a dress will have to [[wait]] til I get a raise (boo salary freeze/recession). However, the jackets were [[incredibly]] [[reasonably]] priced, around $100-150 and again, very cut. Men's clothes - not totally my [[taste]], a lot of JT style hats and button down shirts ala martini ranch \""I'm dressed up!\""\nBut, I can afford the jewelry, and oh it is cute, cute, cute. Picked up a five-piece, simple silver toned ring for $6 - yeah, you heard me, $6 - and I get compliments on it all the time. Also picked up a nice little silver feather necklace for the sister for xmas and she loved it. The sis had seen one at U.O. or something for like $29, but I got her the one every girl at HH *won't* have for $18. AND, i can say about the men's selection is that I LOVE the hand-screen-printed (can you hand screen print? Does that makes sense) ties ($30)! In bright jewel tones like peacock blue, hot pink and lime green, with awesome prints like an [[octopus]] ... or a bicycle. Bought one for the BF for xmas and gave it to him early so he could wear it at his friend's xmas party and it was a hit! Very unique and incredibly stylish - and I'm a winner cause I'm the cool ass GF that got it for him. \nEverybody wins!!!\[[nI]] was going to give four stars, but how cool is shopping before hh at the Roosevelt?

My girlfriend and I went to this Public Urban Bar (come on guys, just call it a pub) after reading Matt C's glowing review on here, mostly because the lure of nickel PBR's could not be ignored forever.\n\nAfter finally figuring out how to get into the damn place, we took our seats and ate some food (and drank some real beer) until 9PM, when the PBR party officially started.\n\nI tried the roast beef sliders, which were about as tasty as the roast beef sandwiches at Arby's. That is, worth about three bucks. They couldn't be simpler, either. Roughly four inches of roast beef between two buns with (I think) some sort of aioli thrown in so it at least has some sort of flavor.

I'm pretty sure it's the entire staff's first day, every day.\n\nBetween the moderate inaccessibility compared to other pubs in town, the extremely high prices on everything (seriously, nine bucks for a Blue Moon?), and the unremarkable food, I can't recommend this place unless you've got friends who really insist on meeting up there -- or you go on a Tuesday night for some really cheap (in multiple senses) beer. I hear the actual burgers are actually quite good though, so maybe I'll try one soon. I'll have to save up for a while first, though.

This place has \""Family restaurant\"" written all over it.  You can tell that they care about what they serve and serve it with pride. Fresh juices, warm homemade lavash with sesame seeds, and everything is natural! This was my third trip back and I enjoyed it very much each time. I've tried their fresh carrot juice, chicken and lamb wraps and my personal favorite, Ghormeh Sabzi! I sure wish we had a place like this in Tucson. The market is great too. My wife had me pick up some saffron while I was there to bring back home!

Motel 6 with a broken down elevator. No wifi, food sucked and everything was way overpriced. WAY overpriced. The bed was comfortable. The pillows were not. The air conditioner doesn't have a thermostat in the wall. Way way outdated rooms. 25 inch tv?????  Look elsewhere.  Oh yeah, there's not enough parking for the guests let alone casino visitors.  had to park 6 gazillion miles away every time and mostly on top of the garage in the sun.

Ok, folks. You might think that I am not 'Merican, but I have never been sold on the culinary possibility behind a hot dog. Franktuary certainly did not change my mind.\n\nI decided to give the ole oscar meyer another go. The place is reminiscent of something where people would come up to your jalopy in roller skates (Oh no! they kidnapped Chet, what are we gonna do?-Frank and Joe Hardy)\n\nThe selections looked intriguing, and anytime I see kimchi, its a done deal. The dogs themselves were delicious and meaty. The toppings were not overflowing, as they should be on a hot dog...because, well, it is a hot dog. \n\nMy major complain is the bun. Whether its a burger or a dog, if you are trying to serve gourmet everyday food, you need to provide an AWESOME BUN!!!!!!!1 These were run of the mill buns that got soggy. Jesus, toast them or something. I am sure the minds  that are behind creative culinary hot dogs can think of something better to do in lieu of generic soggy buns.\n\nThe fries were good, and you  would pay about the same thing as Wendy's or something of that nature, so thats a plus. \n\n\nCliff Notes Version: \""Meh\""

I just had the opportunity to dine at Samba Grill again 2 days ago and the food was as great as ever!  I love everything here, from the delicious bread with unusual dipping sauces they start you out with, to the Brazilian salad and of course the meats.  This time, I opted for the Rodizio experience and really enjoyed the flavors of all the meats I tried.  Their creamed spinach is some of the best I've ever found anywhere (I'm always looking for great creamed spinach, Samba's is pretty much the benchmark standard in my book). \n\nI also love the carmelized plantains and candied carrots they serve, and like that all the sides are all-you-can-eat, sorta like going to a buffet but not having to get up and go get your food!  I've made it a point to dine here every time I'm in Vegas for the past 12 years since I discovered this place.  Enjoy!

This was my worst experience at this location... This whole experience started bad from the beginning when we arrived. First off the valet was closed, not a big problem we will self park which is not close, you have to walk the miracle mile to get to the hotel.\n We arrive to check in and that took us standing an hour & a half in line before we said screw this were not gonna miss our show. We stepped out of the line and decided to leave our luggage at the concierge. \nHours later, We finally checked into the hotel and were given a crappy room that was 2 queens not 1 king like we had asked. There was a seat that had suspicious white stain on the arm.  The restroom was horrible, we had dirty towels, a running toilet bowl, the water in the shower did not drain and the mirror in front of the restroom was broken. \nSo ofcourse I call the front desk and was told they could not do anything for the night everything was booked up. I told them to please have the manager call me so I can speak to them personally. I was told he would give me a call later. \nSo next day rolls around and was moved to a better room with a better view, which was very nice. Again I asked if I can talk to the manager and was told he was in a meeting. \nNow we go to check out and I asked one last time to talk to the manager and again he was in a meeting. So we left a negative comment card and ask for them to contact us so we can share our bad experience...\n So screw this place they lost my business. I've had very great times here before but I will not return no mo. I do not leave negative reviews but this one had to be done. I have pictures to share. \n\nOh and incase your wondering I have not been contacted by management staff to this date. VERY PROFESSIONAL PLANET HOLLYWOOD!!!

This location is awful! HORRIBLE customer service. Not one employee smiled at us or greeted us. After we already ordered they told us that they were out of the pumpkin shmear, (which is the only reason we went) and we told them that we would like a refund and we will go to a different location. They rudely gave us a refund and while we were walking out told us that the pumpkin season was over and would not find it anywhere else. Why would they not inform us of this before we ordered and before our refund. Not to mention that advertisement of the pumpkin items are located all over their store. Because of their extremely poor customer service, we will never be returning to this location, and I suggest you save yourself from a bad mood and find a different location as well.

We saw an ad in the Seven magazine and seeing as how close it is to our home, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try.  We ended up bragging about the place to his good friend from Wooster about the delicious food we just devoured. \nThe first visit, my bf had a steak bomb, and I had the chicken finger sub. I normally order chicken finger subs hot out here because the sauce level from back home in Buffalo is always one level down. I ordered hot and holy crap, my lips were red! I LOVE IT!!!!  Lots of onions and tomatoes on it. My bf's steak bomb was just that...bomb...in a West Coast lingo kind of way.  We also shared the cheesy tater tots which are served in a big round takeout container with melted cheese, bacon, and green onions. Fabulous! \nJust went back tonight, and my bf did the happy dance because they are now serving New England Clam Chowder!!!!!  He loved it, along w/ his steak bomb.  I had a cajun chicken bomb and the thing was so damn loaded with meat, when I unwrapped it, it almost rolled off the table. \""I had a chicken bomb stain on my bright yellow shirt...\""  It was super flavorful and as always, we promise the boys we'll be back. \nThe staff here is great, always helpful and pleasant.

I am a big fan of sushi and have been to many different sushi bars in the tempe area. I was so impressed by sushi time! First big plus - an immaculately clean and rarely crowded establishment. I am always surprised that there are never many people there when I go - maybe I just go at the wrong time, or people don't know about it, because the place rocks.  You order up at the front counter, and then they bring your tray to you when the food is ready - drinks are self serve also. \nTheir sushi is really delicious and fresh! They make one of the best Las Vegas Rolls i've ever had - make sure to try it if you go. Also, every day they have 'combos' posted, where it's $10.99 for two types of rolls (the rolls in each combo are different every day) and miso soup. For the price, delicious sushi, and clean, modern atmosphere, I would definitely recommend this place!

I used to come here all the time with a buddy of mine to chow down on pizza and lasagna. Now, I don't go out of my way for it so much. \n\nThis place used to be so good, man. Like, super good. They had amazing pizza, though the prices were high. Still, we'd come here every other weekend. We were regulars, and it was our opinion at the time that the pizza here could not be beat. \n\nThat was then. Now, it seems that their pizza is less awesome. I don't know whether that's because the quality has indeed dropped, or maybe it's because I've gotten used to it and now I expect amazing things from this this place. Their lasagna is still good, though I'm certain that it has dropped in quality from where it used to be. \n\nBecause the pizza here is more expensive, it's easy for you to spend $15 on a meal here. Not that it's not worth it, but it just seems kinda pricey. The cool thing is that it's inside the NYNY, so you can eat a ton and then kinda walk around for a little and do the tourist thing. That way you don't feel super bad about eating so much!

Christmas Day Brunch at The Gallery at Ballantyne Hotel was excellent.   There were beautiful winter wonderland ice sculptures to set the mood.  It was a beautiful buffet set up with carvers on two ends and the side dishes in the middle.  The turkey was very moist and tender.  The most delicious collard greens were one of the best dishes ever.   I don't usually care for mashed potatoes but these were divine.   There was another setup for cheeses, grilled vegetables, and salads.  There was an omelette station set up outside the main dining room.  The dessert station was set up with beautiful Christmas desserts and there was a bananas foster station. We had decent service by a very polite sever.  They were very busy.

Since I work in Food & Beverage here in Las Vegas(for over 14 years) and have opened my share of celebrity chef restaurants, I always make allowances for the \""learning phase\"" of a new restaurant during the first month or so. Surprisingly though, my comments on what could have been better during my visit aren't about the atmosphere, service staff, or the food. All of those were just fine...and I'm sure will get even better as the restaurant matures. The only serious issue I saw...\n\nElizabeth...If you are going to walk around checking on people's experiences (as you know a restaurant owner should!) make sure you stop and check on everyone....not just the people you already knew socially! You walked past my table (my GF and I) in the middle of the dinning room more than a dozen times without even a glance or smile to acknowledge us even existing...and yet went to every table surrounding us to say \""Hi\"" to groups you obviously knew already! Shame on you because this is \""Restaurant 101\"" and I know you know better!  Making new guests feel just as important as the returning ones is going to be crucial to building business levels you'll need to succeed in that spot longer than Nora's did!\n\nChef....really enjoyed all the different presentations of quinoa!

Found this place while driving outside the airport before I had to catch a flight. Was tired of eating at the usual places in the airport, so ventured out and found a good meal.  I got there ~5:30 on a Friday, so the place was almost empty, decor was nice, somewhat upscale w/o being too stuffy, and the staff courteous and attentive.\n\nI perused the menu for anything that would catch my eye, nothing stood out, seemed more or less your typical Italian menu. So I looked over the featured three-course meal - starter, entree and dessert for $30, where you pick one in each category, figured why not.  I ordered the lobster gnocchi, ribeye w/ red wine sauce and tiramisu. On top of that they had some nice touches of a higher-end restaurant, complimentary tomato brushetta and mango sorbet before the entree. The gnocchi was the best - the vodka sauce was light yet present, steak was undercooked in some parts and tiramisu was good  though espresso was faint if there at all.\n\nOverall, I thought this was a very good deal for the food, service and amenities.  If I had to pay more, it be more like a 3-star, but if you can take advantage of the three-course special, it's well worth it.

i've long been told of the goodness of soups from Union of Genius.  sadly though i'd never had a chance to visit this soup cafe as i don't work in town so couldn't go for a lunch break and don't live particually close by so not great for a weekend soup take away either.  but luckily, i was working at the Blood Donor Centre up the road and made it a point to get my lunch from Union of Genius.\n\nthe shop itself is small, with space for abotu 6 or so people to eat in around a very large wooden table.  however i was taking away, so it wasn't a problem.  there were five soup options and all sounded incredibly appealing but i was persuaded by the counter lady to have the roasted cauliflower with almond flakes.  i got a side of the olive bread and was on my way with soup and bread placed in a convenient carrier bag for me to bring back to the office.\n\nthe soup was lovely, seriously lovely and a massive portion!  it was [[warming]] and soooo incredibly tasted i wished i had opted for the large instead of the regular.  the roasted cauliflower added a really nice taste that was balanced well with the almonds and i think there was cumin seeds for a bit of earthiness.  my olive bread was similarly tasty and good for dunking in the soup.  it was with great sadness that i finished my last spoonful and used the last of my bread to mop up any soup left on the container.  it's unlikely i'll have a repeat visit to Union of Genius soon, but i would highly recommend this place for soupy goodness!

I'm officially addicted to the Mutabel (babaganush) at this place! The Armenians that run this joint have become my buds and know exactly what I like these days. Usually, I pull up to the front of the store located next to Trader Joe's and the owners are outside sipping espresso and smoking cigarettes like some scene from \""Eastern Promises\"" . For some reason, this relaxed mentality sets the mood for a great meal. I usually get hummus, but the Mutabel is the best in town by far! The service is sometimes a little awkward, but I forgive it because the staff is also very kind. If you're in the area, I suggest you make a stop by the Royal Cuisine for a healthy and fresh Armenian lunch or dinner!

My wife has been asking to go to Kneaders since we have moved up to Phoenix. I was shocked how small the portions were and even more shocked when I heard the total cost of our meal. This place is expensive! \n\nI guess you pay for the grandmas attic hoarder atmosphere of the place. There is a lot of random knick knacks and ribbon and feminine gifty things populating the center of the restaurant. I thought it was very odd and distracting but my wife said it made the place feel homey. \n\nThe service has been less than stellar during our three visits and the ladies taking our order are always grumpy and don't look like they want to be there, or helping us. \n\nThe deserts didn't blow me away either.

I have been to this airport so many times the past year not because I am an party animal or a gambler.

The city should spend some tax money from all the Casino on this airport!!!!\n\nThere are slot machines everywhere, but I don't see that many people actually play. I never did, so I have no feelings towards that. I'm neither bothered by it. They do have few food options like Nathan's burger or sandwiches and hot dog. There is, by the way, a good chocolate store in the middle of the airport if you want to get some gifts or just get your chocolate fix here. It's not cheap. But good chocolate is never cheap anyway. \n\nEven it's very old, but everything is pretty well organized. All the signs are clear. And the line for getting a cab is long but super fast and super organized. No need to bump into anyone to fight for taxi, just get in line, the staff will tell you exactly what to do and where to go. Thumbs up!\n\nThere's also shuttles to most of the hotels. I believe it is $7 per person. It's very convenient.

[[Possibly]] the first AND [[last]] time here.  I had read about this place and thought that it was a cool concept....do one thing and do one thing well (chicken fingers).  I decided to stop here on my way down to the game.  I went through the drive through and placed my order.  I ordered \""The Box Combo\"" which included 4 chicken strips, cole slaw, fries and a drink.  The price wasn't bad (under $7.00) and it sounded like it [[would]] be fantastic.  The drive through line took at least 10 minutes before I got my food.  Once I did get the goods, I pulled over, parked and dug in.  Here is how the food was............\n\nChicken Strips-  Meh!  The strips were a decent size but there were a couple of things working against them.     #1.  These things were WAY too hot.  I appreciate freshly made food but maybe you might want to let that shit sit for a minute and drain or something.  These were so hot you couldn't [[even]] eat them without burning your mouth.  [[Even]] after mouth breathing/cooling and sitting there for 10 minutes, my last strip was as scorching as the first!    #2.  I really didn't like the breading.  It is a really thin coating that is just a bit greasy.  The breading was kind of falling off in pieces and just seemed a bit \""off\"".     #3.  The taste of these things.  They were super duper plain [[jane]].  It seemed like they could use a ton more seasoning and really didn't have any flavor.  The dipping sauce helped, but still didn't make up for the fact that these strips looked good but had no taste.  Were they the nastiest things I have ever had?  No.  Can I make just as good or better chicken strips at home?  Yep!  This is their niche and unfortunately I didn't think they were anything special.  I much prefer Popeyes strips...at least they have flavor!\n\nFries-  Standard crinkle cut fries.  They were ok.  Crispy but needed some more salt.\n\nCole Slaw- Didn't try it.\n\nTexas Toast-  This was the best part of the meal.  Kind of reminded me of Sizzlers cheese toast but lesser quality (That is one thing Sizzler does better than anyone else....cheese toast.)  If I could have traded my fries and/or slaw for another slice, I would have done it.\n\nSoda- Coke Zero tasted a little \""off\"".  I have had a few instances so far in Phoenix where fountain soda has tasted weird.  Don't know what it is but Raising Cane's Coke Zero is in the same boat.\n\nSauce- Their sauce is a mayo based sauce...I took a tiny taste and didn't like it.  I did pay extra to get some honey mustard.  Their honey mustard sauce is actually pretty good.\n\nService in the drive through was friendly.  Slow but friendly.  I personally probably won't come back but I can see myself ending up here eventually...my wife loves chicken strips and I'm sure she will want to try this place out and I will be forced here with her.  Meh, right?  We shall see................

2.5 [[stars]]. I loved the decor, the steak and company was awesome, but oh the service. As we looked over the menu, I picked up their dining club brochure on a whim.

[[Simply]] put, it got [[annoying]]. \n\nAnyways, on to the menu. We decided to share an appetizer of three jumbo shrimp sauteed in dijon sauce. It was good, but could have been presented better on a small platter, not a large flat dish with literally three split shrimp rolling around. lol\n\nThe side of wild mushrooms was sauteed and delicious. The string beans had the option of sauteed in garlic or steamed; we got it steamed and we agreed they were a bit tough and possibly undercooked. \n\nOk, the filet mignon 9 oz. medium rare - sooo good. Cooked to perfection. The salmon was HUGE....neither of us could finish it. May have something to do with the taste, too - even though it was topped with butter, the fish itself was a little \""bland,\"" as my friend stated (his words, not mine!). \n\nAfter our plates were cleared and as I was leaning forward saying something, our server inserted a small-desk-sized platter of six desserts on the table and asked us which one we wanted. I remember a feeling of wow, a bit rude and I just lost my train of thought. Plus, he didn't even ask if we had room for dessert. Well, we didn't. \n\nNow I come on to yelp and find out they had restaurant week this whole time. The server didn't even mention this, even though my dish was on the special menu. Grrrr....

I'm not sure what the hype is about. Having experienced the Gourmet Burger craze in both LA and Dallas maybe my expectations are just too high.

The goat cheese did not [[compliment]] the beef in any [[way]].

This is where Holsteins really fell [[short]] for me. I've had $10 burgers that blow this one away. [[Not]] to be super whiny but on top of the [[food]] not meeting my expectations  the service was a bit slow and my burger was slightly overcooked. Nothing egregious, but I would feel remiss to not point it out here. We tried the Lobster Mac & Cheese appetizer to start and I can't help but compare it to the Lobster Mac at The Capital Grille which is of better quality, a larger portion and actually cheaper than Holsteins. Even the steak fries were uninspired and blah. \n\nOverall I was disappointed at every turn by this place. The food was acceptable and I won't say it was a bad meal but it does not live up to the bar they have set for themselves. I would not go back.

This is my first 1-star review, after roughly 30 [[reviews]].\nAlthough reviews are subjective in nature, I think that Yelp reviews have an air of objectivity, which is why their reputation is what it is. I follow that credo. \nSince I've lived in Las Vegas, for one reason or another (mainly to play penny slots), I've been to practically every major casino in town, at all times of day: 6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, and most recently 2 AM.  \nThis is my review of the atmosphere of the Fiesta Rancho casino. I've never [[stayed]] in one of their rooms (because I'm a local), [[I]] can't remember eating at any of their restaurants, I've [[never]] skated on their rink, and I've never gone into any of their nightclubs.\nI'm still [[scratching]] my head, regarding reviews written by other locals who live in the NW, yet have stayed in Fiesta rooms (and have checked-in multiple times). Can anyone clear that up for me?\nIn any event, I've not gambled at the Fiesta Rancho more than I have at any other casino.\nHowever, I've personally heard or have been in close proximity to 3 disturbing incidents at this casino, whereas I've not seen 1 at all the other casinos combined.\nWhile playing there, I've heard gun shots coming from the other side of the casino. Many years ago, my car was vandalized in their parking lot. At the time, I didn't pay it a second thought. Last night, a woman's purse was stolen, and the robbers escaped without a security guard in sight. In fact, the woman screamed for a security guard, and one didn't come over for 2 or 3 minutes.\nMaybe this is just a coincidence, but I really don't believe in coincidences.\nLike [[I]] said...Even though my own property was vandalized years ago, I continued to play there through last night, so this review is not biased from that event.\nBut, after last night, I'll never play there again. I don't want to worry about potential wrong-doings.\nI'll gamble with money, but I don't wish to gamble with anything more precious.\nSorry.

I work next door at the Wynn/Encore, so Im at this place often. A top 5 place in town hands down...maybe higher for Mexican food. Believe the hype and visit this place. They are famous for their adobada ( spicy pork....not very spicy), but its delish nonetheless. Their adobada or carne asada fries are [[great]] an their tacos are authentic. \n\nPlace gets very [[busy]] and dirty. So dont expect your meal to be perfect. Sometimes your tacos will be thrown together too fast and be below what they might be on other visits.

The food here was unbelievable for fast, healthy mexican food. (no lard in the bean burro major plus)\n\nALTHOUGH the set up of this place is a NIGHTMARE. Parking is straight up unplanned, and when you walk in \""it's like checking in at an italian airport\"" (-J. Donaughy) - there is absolutely no order.\n\nI was probably the only person who wasn't smart enough to call in my order, and everyone eating at the restaurant looked like they were in hour 3 of their 4 hour lunch.

[[We]] had a large group, and took up the entire patio.  However, there was only 1 waitress for about 40 of us.  She forgot orders, brought out wrong things, and had no idea who ordered which thing.  She overcharged me too many drinks that had already been paid for.\n\nBut [[since]] they have decent food, and GREAT prices during happy hour, we decided to come a third time.\nApparently the manager didn't [[appreciate]] our business because he immediately asked when we would be leaving.  He said that we take up the entire patio and no one else can sit out there because we take all the seats.  Mind you, every single person there is a customer.  Every single one of us ordered multiple drinks and plenty of food.  It's not like anyone was just sitting taking a seat, but not paying for anything.\nThis manager was so rude, that my co-workers debated leaving right then.  We will definitely not come back again.  We also do a fund raiser with them and our school once or twice a year.  We are planning on canceling that.\n\nThey have lost our business now, which is unfortunate.\n\n\nIf you have a large group, go elsewhere.  If you are looking for cheap drinks, and there's only a few of you, this is an okay place.

I took the class, and now they  just called to tell me that I have to buy it through living social.  So, I have to pay another $19 to get this deal.  I just paid $20.   When trying to explain that the receptionist took my $20 with the verbal agreement of unlimited yoga for a month,  she hung up on me.\n    If I would have gotton the deal, I would have gone four times to feel I got my money's worth.

Well, there was another car that pulled in and they stopped working on my car for 15 minutes as they chatted and laughed with the other \""customer.\""  They topped off some fluids and the driver slipped them a $20 and he left. Save yourself time and frustration and go to ANY other Jiffy Lube location.

ate there [[recently]] for [[dinner]], it was [[wonderful]]. i ordered the goat curry and was excited to try goat for the first time right after i found out it is the most consumed meat on earth outside of the US BUT the table of 12 Indian gentleman behind us had ordered it all....which led me to believe these [[guys]] know what they are doing. instead i tried the lamb and it was perfect. i really liked the candor of our waiter \""andrew\"", which was not his name but he called himself that with a grinning smirk; i told him i had ordered kingfisher lagers before and would love to try another beer since they had a few indian beers, he told me to stay with the kingfisher. also, once he told me the goat curry wasn't available i ordered tandoori lamb, he assured me it was good but encouraged me to try the curried lamb since i originally ordered goat curry. my ladyfriend ordered a veggie dish and loved it, we got some bread as well, she ordered some REASONABLY (which is becoming more rare these days) priced wine. all in all the food was very [[good]] and the service was near perfect, i like when a waiter can read what you are looking for, makes reco's on that judgment and nails them. i will be going back to maharani frequently for both the food and smiling faces that provide you perfect service.

Pretty much agree with the other reviews but have to say that the super long wait for a table and ridiculously loud atmosphere (although it is really kinda cool and trendy) is worth it for the turkey pastrami sandwich. Forget everything else on the menu and get this sandwich. Just do it. It's the best sandwich I've ever had and I've had some amazing sandwiches and I'm super picky, too!! The cole slaw is amazing. The turkey is smokey and lean. The pretzel bun is to die for. SO good. We also always get the cheese plate. We're from Wisconsin. We know good cheese. This place has a great cheese plate. I also tried the grilled cheese sliders but seriously, nothing else is as good as the turkey. Sat next to a guy who almost had an orgasm over the monkey bread dessert but I didn't try it (should have!) Overall, it's worth the wait and noise but they really, really need to get on Open Table and start taking reservations. Would help a lot. Also need some waiting areas and to cut back on the volume of the music or add some acoustic elements so you're not deaf when you leave. Wouldn't mind some better cocktails, too. I've had two and neither of them were very good. I'll go for wine next time. Will still go back for the food but hope to see some improvement on the flow of the restaurant, overall. I'll continue to try to go on weeknights and late at night so I can get in without standing outside for an hour.

We ordered delivery for the first time from this restaurant last week and it was great!  You can do all of your ordering online which I thought was super helpful - and - they delivered until 10pm!!. \n\nWe had the sweet and sour chicken (5/5), chicken with cashew nuts (5/5), curry chicken with onions (4/5) and spring rolls (3/5).  The rice came with each of the main dishes and was delicious!  The curry did not taste milky-ish as I have become accustomed to and enjoy, but instead was on the watery side and had a lot of bell pepper flavor. Overall good and I will definitely be back in person!

Some of the worst, over priced, bland food I have ever had in my life!  \""Garlic\"" bread they brought to the table had no flavor and was cold. Wouldn't give it to my dogs. The salad was composed of the cheapest lettuce known to man...with 2 or 3 good pieces of lettuce thrown in there. Insulting basically. Then the pasta comes. Meat sauce was watery with very few pieces of meat. Beers were over priced. Tables were so close together that my boyfriends chair got hit every time a waiter walked by. Once the 60 year + crowd stops coming, this place will hopefully go out of business. Ugh!!!! I want my 50 bucks back

Times Square also serves breakfast, kind of unusual for an Italian [[eatery]] but no problem as far as I am concerned--keep serving incredible Italian meals and I am completely satisfied.

[[Z]] problem is that no one locally will take responsibility for the behavior of the drivers. Customer service try to help but they are located in another state. I asked to be connected to the location where the local driver originates, but when I asked for \""Art,\"" the supervisor,  he of course, was not available, and a message for him to call me was never returned.\n\nThis is the worst delivery service I've encountered in quite some time. The previous Sunday afternoon, the US Postal Service delivered another package, and the day before, UPS was promptly at my door to pick up a package. Years ago, FedEx was the premier delivery service, but they have clearly lowered their standards for driver conduct to the point that they have no standard at all--and clearly drivers know there will be no consequences when they \""blow off\"" a customer or several customers, because even their supervisor doesn't return customer calls. Why should drivers care?

Totally underwhelmed and it took 45 minutes to bring out a mediocre po-boy sandwhich and a jumbalaya.  We just sat there twiddling our thumbs eating some bread (which was probably the best part of the meal to be honest). \n\nWe weren't even given any explanation until we were paying our bill.  Apparantly Emeril was in town and was going to drop by the restaurant and everyone was on \""pins and needles\""...I'd think they'd want to step up their game instead of fall on their ass? \n\nWaiter seemed to be pretty knowledable, they must have trained him with a script because the way he described the food (great) did not match up to the final result (not so great). \n\nStarted off with Calamari, which was about average. The dipping sauces were non-descript but the banana peppers were a nice touch on the top.  \n\nThe carnitas po-boy was very mediocre. The fried pickles were not worth mentioning and the taste was something I could replicated if I got some french bred, put deli cole-slaw in there with some carnitas from baja fresh.  Keep in mind, perhaps I would only use 1/3 of the amount of carnitas from a baja burrito as there was barely any on the sandwich.

So excited to have such a nice place opening in SE Mesa!  We usually have to drive to Scottsdale, Tempe, Chandler, etc. to get this kind of atmosphere.  For drinks we ordered wine and sake.  Appetizers were half off for happy hour, so we got gyzo (pot stickers) and calamari.  The calamari came in rings and was very crispy.  We then split 3 sushi rolls - the citrus roll was excellent!  We didn't wait long for anything, and even though it was our server's second day on the job, she did great and was very attentive.  Only complaint, as someone has already mentioned, is that you have to ask for water.  I prefer they automatically bring water out with the drinks, especially when it's 110 degrees outside.

This restaurant is one of the filthiest I've ever visited in the entire world (and I travel frequently to third-world countries on business). During my lunchtime visit the dining room tables were strewn with uncollected plates and uneaten food, the steam table buffet had food scraps hanging all over it, and the carpeting was full of stains from ground-in food particles. If that wasn't bad enough the buffet food was terrible, too.  It all appeared to come from frozen, restaurant supply entrees--very oily stuff with poor smell, taste and appearance.  During the 30 minutes I was there, someone at another table complained about an unidentified object in her noodles, while another customer complained that the buffet was essentially empty.  This place isn't even worth the 5.99 +tax for lunch, even if it does include beverage.  YUCKERS to the core!

I ate here for lunch and unfortunately the food took a while to be served.  The prices seemed high for lunch time and they didn't really have a lunch menu.  I ordered an Italian sandwich and I received something that really didn't resemble a sandwich at all. \n\nMost likely not coming back anytime soon.

It had a super buffet for a Saturday!  I loved every morsel of it.\nKeep in mind it's south Indian so it'll be on the spicy side,  But everything has amazingly bold flavors. The staff were so nice, they helped my grown daughter choose her food since she is new to Indian food and doesn't like spicy.\n I'll definitely be back.\nGo try it!

The staff is great! Met a few of them while working at a restaurant in Station Square and all of them were some of the nicest people I ever met. Years later I still go through them for concerts because they have the best customer service. Will support them just for that.

... I have never been in a hardware store with employees who were way more interested in standing around talking to each other rather than helping customers. When we finally got someone's attention they acted annoyed and were so unhelpful. Will not be coming in this store again.

\""Firefly\"" is somewhat of a misplaced [[moniker]] choice since it invokes memories of the excellent, if short lived Joss Whedon sci-fi series.\[[n]]\nOverall, a very simply, and elegantly designed restaurant.  In a [[city]] where excess and flash are norms, Firefly provides a refreshing milieu.  I got the feeling that it caters less to tourists, but [[rather]] to the [[local]] white collar work force.\n\nOur lunch menu was a assembled tapas selection.  There were enough choices to cobble together an expansive meal, yet not too large as to be overwhelming.  \n\nThe obligatory free appetizer consisted of toasted baguette slices with green garlic olives and sweet jalapeno butter.  These was also a good and extensive selection of Tazo teas.\n\nSome examples of sampled food: (the good)\nMushrooms stuffed with chorizo:\nGarlicy shrimp (came with plenty of sauce)\nPotato bravas (less [[spicy]] than usual, and much [[tastier]])\nTuna Tartar (not technically a traditional Tapa, but a [[good]] variation on the neo classic dish)\n\nThe mediocre:\nArtichoke hearts on toast (tasted too canned)\nGazpacho (lacked definition)

This is my 3rd time here so I finally decided to leave a review . [[Food]] is [[great]] . Great atmosphere. Awesome [[pancakes]]!

[[But]] I def [[recommend]] it my only [[think]] they should [[improve]] on is the [[bacon]] wasn't that impressed but overall everything was too [[notch]]!

Dear Roka Akor,\n\nI want this to be a love letter but it's not. [[We]] had such a short relationship but I feel we have to [[break]] up.\n\nI spent $200 at dinner for 3 ozs of fish, one [[appetizer]], and [[two]] drinks. [[And]] the [[worst]] part was it didn't [[even]] taste very [[good]]. \n\nOur waiter was obsequiously friendly and recommended that if I was a sushi [[connoisseur]] I should have the best [[sushi]]. Fine, OK, I [[hear]] Roka that you are a top 10 sushi [[restaurant]] in USA. I have had sushi at some of the others, let's see how you stack up. I am willing to pay for quality.\n\nYour sashimi was of questionably quality, marinated to perdition in order to hide the fishy [[taste]] that only [[emerges]] when fish begins to rot. The fatty tuna was regular tuna. The portions were tiny! Seriously about 3 ozs of fish for two orders of the chef's choice best sashimi. Some of the flavors of the marinates were quite good, I give you that. [[But]] just like spandex does not make the obese look sexy, so vinegar and soy does not make low quality fish sexy. I have eaten fish off the boat at the fish market in Tokyo, not only were you not nearly as good, you weren't even nearly as good as some conveyor belt dining sushi I've had. Don't tell me this is the best you can do!\n\nI must have looked like I had money, or looked too blonde (I'm a brunette btw), because the happy hour menu was never mentioned. Happy hour prices were in effect but the one appetizer I ordered which should have been covered by the happy hour menu was charged at full price. \n\nI couldn't run away from you fast enough. Return? No. Why would I want to return to an abusive relationship?

This is the best bar in the area. The food on the menu is diverse, and everything is pretty much great. I believe there are 14-17 beers on tap (6 or 7 oggi's, 3 domestic garbage, 5-6 rotating guest craft beers). Happy hour goes from 3-7 and varies depending on the day, with all day happy hour friday-sunday. Steph is an awesome bartender, so stop by for lunch! Stop reading reviews and just go there
