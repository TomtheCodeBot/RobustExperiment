Just showed up to Phoenix with a buddy looking for a place to hang out that resembled the fabled Mort's Martini Bar of Wichita, Kansas.  I'm going to be residing here for a while, so I needed a place I could call home.  Magnums is quite a good location, and while it's no Mort's, it is definitely a place I could find myself quite often.\n\nFirstly, let me tell you, finding a place where you can enjoy your cigar and a beverage at the same time is exceedingly hard to do in this modern day of social awareness and health babysitting.  If you show up at a cigar bar, you should be able to enjoy it there.  \n\nWe [[found]] this place relatively easily.  It's in a strip mall, but the interior is very comfortable.  The decor [[instantly]] made me feel welcome and at [[home]].  The staff was welcoming as well.  They made sure to [[greet]] us as we walked in the door, and the humidor is large.  The only downside is on the day we visited a majority of our [[favorites]] had been purchased by like minded patrons.  [[The]] [[exterior]] of the place does not meet the interior.  (Insert Doctor Who \""It's bigger on the inside\"" reference.\n\nThe staff made some excellent suggestions on local [[brews]], and if we wanted to, we could try out many of the beverages to see if we liked it before we bought it.  The selection of their beers and beverages was extensive.  \n\nSecondly, [[I]] cannot emphasize the importance for any business to focus on customer service.  The staff here had it down.  While it was a bit [[slow]] for a Friday night, the staff was eager to help, taking the opportunity to focus on the customers.  I've been to many a bar where it's a slow night and the bar staff is too busy [[goofing]] off to pay attention to you.  These guys were professional.\n\nThirdly, if you [[find]] yourself [[stranded]] in the beautiful deserts of Arizona, make sure and visit this place.  It's [[worth]] your [[time]].  I will be [[back]], and it's earned a five [[star]] from me.  [[Glad]] to have been here!\nThirdly,

We ordered take out from here for dinner last night. \n\nAfter paying our $70 tab (3 soups, 2 rolls), we opened the containers up at home to be incredibly disappointed. The soups were just ok, not the same quality as the first time, not horrible but just OK. \n\nThe sushi is where we were REALLY pissed off. $15/roll to get 6 pieces of what looks like BUDGET SUSHI. We could have gone to Yume Sushi and gotten a kick ass awesome sushi roll (or two!) for that price but apparently here, it gets you a 6 piece baked (microwaved) rice roll with hardly any other ingredients smothered in \""spicy\"" (not) mayo sauce with the teensiest bit of roe sprinkled on top. \n\nI'm not gonna lie, I TOTALLY felt downright ROBBED on this meal and I am not a happy camper about it. The food quality for the prices charged is insane. \n\nI won't be back.

So the food was decent, the service was absolutely terrible and I was charged for a soda when all I got was carbonated water... I asked why and the poor waiter said that when they don't charge for it, the owner takes it out of their check.. Are you kidding me? Not like I needed 2 dollars, and not like it was a big deal but it was when the waiter told me about the owner. I will never be back and don't recommend. It looks like they are struggling anyways so good luck attempting to obtain clients with the way you practice  your business and treat your employees. If you are the owner, and you want to reach out to me and talk about it let me know. I'd love to give you a piece of my mind.

Asian buffets [[scare]] me... I usually don't know what half the stuff is, and if I do know what it is, it's a microwaved crazy sauced version of what I'm used to. Granted, I came here with a hungry hoard of UCSD dragon boaters, so we were all starved from a long day of paddling. Yes, I ate, but I was terrified that everyone would be sitting on a toilet for the rest of the night and that we would be totally unable to paddle our races the next day.\n\nMicrowavable edamame was my friend since I saw the costco sized bags sitting on the side (I figured I'd be safe with these), and I attempted to try everything else like the random seafoods, [[mushy]] sushi, and fatty meats. Their desserts were weird generic cakes that seemed to be salvaged from the sale section of the local grocery bakery, so I stuck with the frozen yogurt.\n\nLots of better options out there, but I guess since there were about 50 of us, we were limited.

I'm not sure what happened to this place, but over the last 6 months it has taken several steps in the wrong direction. The quality of the food is the only reason this is a two start review, and not a one star. The service is getting slower every visit, and the pricing fluctuations are ridiculous. The once $.99 breakfast biscuits are now $2.99. Two hundred percent increase in less than 6 months!

Le Sainte Elisabeth is known for its legendary terrace. It's not as grand as the crazy one over at Saint-Sulpice, but its size and in-the-corner-ness does give it quite the [[kick]].\n\nThe inside is pretty nice, and it's got that nice woody bar feeling you expect to see in a proper pub. If the first floor is full (and chances are it will be), there's also a pretty big second floor with much more space. The music at the place is pretty loud though, so you'll have to get pretty up-close-and-personal if you want to talk to someone.\n\nThey turned their fireplace on (with FIRE!) when I was there in the winter, and that was a pretty good spot to hang around until the staff forced us out [[cause]] we were blocking the entrance. Oh also, just a heads up, the terrace is closed in the winter. \n\nThe entrance to the bar is in a small, fully graffiti'd alleyway off of St Catherine street. It's hard to miss the entrance on a night out since there's usually a crowd outside and the graffiti on the wall outside is pretty neat.

This Checkers location is new to the area having only been open a few weeks at the time of this review.  It did not take me long to get there to give it a try though I did allow for the few weeks to pass giving the staff a chance to work out any glitches to their processs.  On my first of what will likely be many visits over the foreseeable future I went with my co-workers.  My boss ordered a BLT and the Baconzilla Fries.  The fries did not last long as she went hog wild on the cheesey bacon topped goodness.  The BLT, however, is still waiting for her.  Not because it is bad but because the fries were so good and so filling.  A different co-worker ordered the heart attack special with a side of all around good badness.  She got the Bacon Roadhouse Burger hold the BBQ sauce, a small order of seasoned fries and the Monsterella Cheese Sticks (fried mozarella).  It all looked great and she gave me the two thumbs up sign when I asked how she enjoyed it all.  That is a [[definitive]] [[win]] from her.  As for me, I ordered the double fish sandwich.  Think about a double Filet-O-Fish from McDonalds and add shredded [[lettuce]].  It was about like that but by the time I got back to the office the fish had gone soggy and lost its [[crispy]] integrity.  I'll take McDonalds for the win on this one.  Besides, not much beats the bun McDonalds uses for their fish sandwich.  Anyhow, I also ordered the Fully Loaded Fries.  They are topped with melty cheese, ranch dressing and bacon bits (real bacon).  I ate about half before getting interrupted with work stuff so I set them aside and finished them the next day.  I liked the fries but they were very salty from being seasoned fries topped with cheese and bacon.  It was a little much but to at least have tried them I am happy.  Next time I go I may try either a chicken sandwich of some sort or perhaps one of the many burgers Checkers has to offer.  I would also try the cheese sticks.  They looked amazing and when dipped in marinara they must taste as good as they look.  I would also like to try some of the dessert options in the future.  They have some unique ice cream treats that sound incredible.  This food may not be good for the body but fast food rarely is.  This is food good for the mind.  You can't help but be happy at a place that serves up as much bacon as Checkers does.

Ehh... I would have rather went to McDonalds or In-n-Out down the street. The Buffalo chicken sandwich was very mediocre and the fries were very low quality. My friend got a burger that was dry and very small for $10.

It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen. \n\nAnd if you want to offer Mackerel on your sushi menu that's as stale as the Talk Threads on Yelp.  Well . . . \n\nIt's UNACCEPTABLE.  It gets it's ass sent back to the kitchen.\n\nBut if you offer. . . tiradito and lobster and oysters and sashimi and black cod and lions and tigers and a baby gorilla (it's Vegas, baby.  Vegas) . . .   that break-dances on your tastebuds and plays the drumline on your tonsils.   \n\nWell . . . It gets it's ass sent to my dancing buddha belly.  Happy buddha belly.\n\n5 Stars.  A couple mishaps that got sent back to the kitchen and off the check.   But the other food more than [[taken]] up for it.  Including the baby gorilla.  And the excellent, good looking service.\n\nAnd about that check.  Well.  Shocking.  Stabbing.  No that's not my heart.  It's my wallet exploding.\n\nSo  . . . 5 Stars to my boyfriend for always knowing that I'm always better at being a drama mamma than ever paying for dinner.  \n\n(Okay!  So I had to wash his underwear for a month.  It's Vegas, baby.  Vegas)\n\nNISHisHOT doesn't take shit from NOBODY.

Very terrible service. I booked and paid for three hotel rooms with 2 beds for my whole family with 8 people online.When we arrived to the hotel and we are getting ready to check in, they told me that there is no more 2 beds rooms available at this time. They only have 1 beds. They said tbey cannot gurantee the rooms !!! They even gave us wrong hotel keys to someone else's hotel room. We were so surprised walking into an occupied room. We had to come back to the front desk and file a complaint. We ended up taking the 1 beds room since the kids were tired. A few of us slept on the floor. I will never recommend coming back with such bad service they provided.

This is the first time I've been to Tony Roma's in Las Vegas.  Being from So Cal, there are several around but haven't ate at one for several years.  Now I know why.\nWe ate at the Las Vegas-Fremont location on 8/28 for dinner only because we were invited by our friends that LOVE this restaurant and make it a tradition to go here when they visit Las Vegas.  There were eight of us.  It was about 5:30 and not crowded.  We were seated in a few minutes.\nService was fair.  Server was courteous and efficient.\nI ordered the Baby Back Ribs Tony Roma size at $19.  Got cole slaw and a baked potato.\nI asked for spicy sauce.\nThe ribs were below average and not very meaty, sauce was not spicy at all.  Baked potato and cole slaw was fair.\nWe were given some bread.  It was dry.  The butter they offer is not butter but very small \""Promise\""  margarine containers in a basket!  Are you kidding?  It took me about five containers for my baked potato and two for my roll.\nButter should be on the plate in a container with the sour cream(got this).  Margarine should be an option for those that don't use butter.\n\nIn summary, Tony Roma's is a below average overpriced restaurant.  There are many other restaurants in this city.  Don't waste your time.

I was almost suckered into getting a drink at the bar waiting the extra 10 minutes... $25 was enough for the two tasteless roles and cold edemame.\n\nIt is a very chic space and I would imagine the ambiance would be nice for a happy hour or date.

Just move the boxes and the furniture to the truck, drive the truck from point A to point B, and unload the truck.\n\nThe first crew that arrived just after 11:00 and did nothing but load 2/3 of the garage for the first hour and a half while they \""waited for a second truck\"" because apparently we have too much stuff to fit in just one.

Now I have to pay for two crews worth of time. The second crew arrived and helped finish the master bedroom and we were finally loaded and moved on to the new house.\n\nAt the new house, all four guys took another 3 hours to unload all the furniture and put it in the proper rooms.\n\nThe wife was quite hungry and left for the new house ahead of me leaving the old house, and she got pizza for us and another for the movers.

I didn't say anything at the time because I was hungry and eating as well, and I expected they wouldn't charge me for this time. [[WRONG]]. They charged me for the nearly full hour they spent eating my food. \n\nAfter over 8 full hours, three trucks (two of them 2/3 full and one completely empty) and two moving crews billed separately at the moving company's request we were finally moved. There was no damage done to any of our gear, and the movers themselves were quite pleasant. My biggest problem is that they moved slow and seemed to not care about time at the same time they were billing hourly. This is completely unacceptable. \n\nThe only issue I had with their treatment of my furniture is that they didn't care which way was right side up. They said we could leave our drawers full and they would just shrink-wrap them and move them in place, so that's exactly what we did. However because they were constantly moving them on edge or upside-down, all the things in the drawers ended up out of the drawers, so we had to physically remove the drawers, pick up all the jumbled contents of the drawers from the interior floor of the dresser, put the drawers back, and replace the contents of the drawers. This is worse than boxing it up and leaving the drawers empty!\n\nI moved into this house in just over 3 hours for just under $400 with 2 movers.

Went on Saturday 12/20/14 for lunch and the 3 of us were seated immediately which was nice, however, we ordered and waited an hour for our food while others around us who were seated after us were being served. Just as we were trying to track down an employee to call a manager to our table after waiting an hour for our food, the server walking towards us had 2 of our 3 plates. We asked him to have the manager come to our table and his response was \""but I have your food here, do you not want it?\"". One of my friends stated \""Surely, we will take the food but can you please still have a manager come see us?\"". We had no silverware to begin eating and waiting for the 3rd plate. We had to track down another waitress and ask for a manager again as some time had passed and there was still no manager in site, nor the 3rd plate of food. The 3rd plate of food finally came out and we asked for silverware and began eating. Throughout the meal, still no manager. The waiter (Carl) was nice and did come around a few times to ask if everything tasted ok. After we were completely done eating, still no manager. Carl came to the table and stated the kitchen was \""backed up and having issues\"" he then stated the assistant manager was the only one working that day and he/she couldn't step out as he/she was assisting the kitchen in getting back on track. He then stated he was able to comp us ($11.00) and apologized for the service. \n\nAs we knew it was not the waiter's fault, we were extremely disappointed in the hour wait, no silverware, and no manager after requesting he/she twice. The cherry on top was the fact that the assistant manager essentially could not come out for a few minutes to speak with a dissatisfied customer. Extremely unprofessional.

Mountain Gate/Trails is [[awesome]]!!  I really enjoyed living there and the only reason I'm not still there is because I bought a house.\n\nRegarding the name, apparently, there are two sides to the complex.  The Gate side & the Trails side.  Ask the complex the difference, I couldn't see one.\n\nSo to the basics....they have a beautiful property that IS dog friendly.  Two fitness centers, two pool complexes that include cabanas and BBQs, TWO business centers with complimentary FAX & internet use.  There is a lovely little trail just behind the property great for walking the pups and meeting peeps & dog-poo bags all through the property.  Although there is not a gated or patch of grass designated for animals, so as long as you're cool with going for a walk on a pretty trail, then you'll enjoy this pet experience. \n\nThe staff was [[always]] [[incredibly]] [[friendly]]!!!  The maintenance crew was great too!!  They have an online maintenance submission where if you have issues or need assistance with something in your apartment you can submit a request online and they get back to you promptly.  Paying rent is a [[breeze]] too, with their online payment system.\n\nGarages are optional and do come with an additional fee. They're VERY small, one car.  So if you're a crappy driver, I don't suggest gettting one, you'll probably bang your car up just trying to get in.\n\nAll the apartments are fully equiptped with a stacked washer/dryer combo, GE appliances, walk-in closets and oversized garden tubs (not to be confused with jacuzzi tubs, there are no jets in these ones).\n\nI NEVER once, no joke, heard my neighbors.  EXCEPT when someone was walking down the hall, that's it.  So no apartment noise.  They also give you the option to choose from several paint colors, for an additional fee of course.  They're newer and very nice, HOWEVER, as I moved out, they were running a lot of new tenant specials and it appeared to be attracting interesting folks.  Which is not bad, but I did [[notice]] a lot more trash being left around.  Whatever, I'm oober picky.  \nBut rent is negotiable, [[I]] weaseled my way into a much lower monthly rent.  So try it, don't be shy!\n\nDo take a gander on their website to see the different floor plans, pictures and other amenities. :)  Good luck!  It has my stamp of approval.

Although there is not a gated or patch of grass designated for animals, so as long as you're cool with going for a walk on a pretty trail, then you'll enjoy this pet experience. \n\nThe staff was [[persists]] [[horribly]] [[cordial]]!!!  The maintenance crew was great too!!  They have an online maintenance submission where if you have issues or need assistance with something in your apartment you can submit a request online and they get back to you promptly.  Paying rent is a [[cinch]] too, with their online payment system.\n\nGarages are optional and do come with an additional fee. They're VERY small, one car.  So if you're a crappy driver, I don't suggest gettting one, you'll probably bang your car up just trying to get in.\n\nAll the apartments are fully equiptped with a stacked washer/dryer combo, GE appliances, walk-in closets and oversized garden tubs (not to be confused with jacuzzi tubs, there are no jets in these ones).\n\nI NEVER once, no joke, heard my neighbors.  EXCEPT when someone was walking down the hall, that's it.  So no apartment noise.  They also give you the option to choose from several paint colors, for an additional fee of course.  They're newer and very nice, HOWEVER, as I moved out, they were running a lot of new tenant specials and it appeared to be attracting interesting folks.  Which is not bad, but I did [[communication]] a lot more trash being left around.  Whatever, I'm oober picky.  \nBut rent is negotiable, [[wanted]] weaseled my way into a much lower monthly rent.  So try it, don't be shy!\n\nDo take a gander on their website to see the different floor plans, pictures and other amenities. :)  Good luck!  It has my stamp of approval.

This is a review of the Lounge area only* \n\nWe came in last night and pulled up four chairs in a corner spot the cocktail waitress started off slow but she was very nice and by the end was great!! We had just come from dinner so no food only alcohol!!

I was pressed for time and desperate for a fill since I couldn't get my regular Nail Technician at the salon I normally go to. I figured I would give this place a try, and it wasn't the worst, but it also wasn't the best.\n\nThe guy who did my nails seemed like he was so bored the entire time he was doing my nails. He wasn't friendly and he actually made me feel unwelcome. \n\nI had coffin style acrylics and he ended up messing up the shape of my pinkies as he was filing them down. They were obviously uneven, but I didn't bother asking him to fix it since I had to leave for work in about an hour anyways. \n\nTowards the end of my fill, he started asking me a little bit about myself and proceeded to ask me what I was interested in pursuing to which I replied, \""Cosmetology\"". \nHe actually stopped doing my nails and looked at me and said, \""You don't want to do this. Do something else.\"" He was a lot ruder about it and yes, I did find it very disrespectful. I understand we all have our bad days, but just because you're unhappy with your job doesn't mean you should put down someone else's idea for pursuing that career/goal.\n\nI normally tip very well and let's just say I didn't give him much and no, I will not be back.

As an avid coffee fan, [[I]] have to [[say]] that [[Caribou]] has won me over. They have [[free]] Wi-Fi, which is great if you find yourself in the area and you need to do some work via computer. When you walk in the door, you feel like you've left the [[Southside]] and entered a [[cozy]] ski lodge. They even have a fireplace surrounded by big, comfy chairs -definitely a plus when you're looking for a place to relax and sip on some espresso. \n\nOne of the cool [[things]] about Caribou is that it has a wider variety of menu items than your typical coffee shop. The oatmeal (try their Blueberry Almond flavor, so good!), breakfast sandwiches and snacks are much better than what you can get at your local Starbucks.

Ate there last night with a group of friends.  The waitstaff was friendly, but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night.  I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.  The fries that went along with it were also extremely salty.  A couple people in the group said their food was okay, but definitely not worth a trip back.  I was quite bummed about this.

Unfortunately I had the worst customer service experience I have had in a really long time. I had to repeatedly ask for drink orders. My friend asked twice to place an order and the order got ignored. We tried to ask another waiter but when asked he said that we had to place it with our waiter and e was going to go get him. Twice we did this the waiter never came. TWO hours later we never got our drinks!!!\n\nIt was honestly the worst case of just not giving a F&#k by the employees there. \n\n\nThe only reason this place deserves a one star is because the food we had was good, even though ordering the food was also quite a challenge.

I don't know man. My dude and I came in here for some drinks before our reservation over at Herbs & Rye and as soon as I walked in I had a bad vibe. I thought the bartender was friendly but the crowd was pretty shifty.  A random guy came over and just started bragging about his job and the people he worked with.  A woman from across the bar kept looking over at me, even after I gave her a good stare down. \nThe best part was that 2 beers and 2 shots of Jameson came in under $10-15. \n \n I like my drinks cheap and this place did that for me, but I also like to be comfortable in my surroundings.

I was at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort for a conference and I had paid for a booth in the Hohokam Ballroom for three days. During my stay my boothmate and I began receiving huge red itchy welts which were bug bites from insects in the ballroom. I went to the concierge who took me into the business center to speak with the manager Kyle King, who apologized and said he would immediately come down to the ballroom to assess the situation. Unfortunately nobody ever came to deal with the insect problem and we continued to receive bites and ended up with around a dozen bites each from our feet up to our knees. The bites were so itchy that they kept us both up at night for a week even while constantly applying medication. I later spoke with a nurse who said that they appeared to be flea bites and that the hotel needed to take action with the problem since flea bites can become infected from the feces fleas leave while on our skin and if they are scratched can lead to scarring.\n\nAfter the event, I called the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort and asked to speak to a manager about this issue. Nobody would connect me to a manager and asked why I needed to speak to a manager in the first place. I explained what had happened during my stay on the property and was told they would find the manager Kyle King I had spoken with and connect me to him. I was put on hold for more than ten minutes and then was told I was going to be connected to the Director of Security, who told me he would get Kyle King's contact information and call me back with that information so I could e-mail photographs of the bug bites I received from my stay on the property. The Director of Security called me back and said his boss wouldn't allow him to give me a managers contact information.\n\nAfter this I e-mailed the resort and was told that since I didn't pay to stay in a hotel room and only paid to stay in the Hohokam Ballroom that they couldn't do anything about it even though this happened on their property and they did nothing about it. And speaking of rooms, I later was informed that some individuals that stayed in hotel rooms on the property during the same time had issues with ants swarming in their rooms which ended up getting into their luggage.\n\nOverall I think it is ridiculous that the hotel wouldn't do anything about the bugs and also that nobody would let me speak to a manager when I had a complaint. I expected a clean and safe environment to be in at the resort, but the resort has bug problems in several different areas which need to be attended to for the safety and health of the guests.

Thanks to Anita for reminding me how [[awful]] this mall is!  I rarely meet a that I cannot find some reason to like.  When it comes to this one, I say just pass it up.  With so much fabulous shopping to be had at The Fashion Show Mall, The Forum Shops and even The Bellagio's shopping area, you could skip this and go to a spa instead!  She is right about the enormous crowds of people here.  The walk ways are pretty narrow which makes things worse.  The stores are the worst of the worst and the people working in them are [[miserable]].  Ooh, I just thought of one thing I could like here.....there is a restaurant owned by IL Fornaio called \""Canaletto\"".  We ate here once and it was pretty good.  Too bad the overall awfulness of the Venetian keeps us away.

Thanks to Anita for reminding me how [[heinous]] this mall is!  I rarely meet a that I cannot find some reason to like.  When it comes to this one, I say just pass it up.  With so much fabulous shopping to be had at The Fashion Show Mall, The Forum Shops and even The Bellagio's shopping area, you could skip this and go to a spa instead!

Gather around little Yelpers, let me tell you about my stay at ye ol' Treasure Island. No, but seriously get ready to hear it.\n\nWe had the penthouse suite here. Our room was beautifully decorated and looked real crisp. Being an all guys birthday weeknd, we wanted to go all out. As soon as entering the room, we immediately fired up the jacuzzi. And 10 minutes later there was water all over the floor due to my fellow comrade who thinks it's not a problem to cannonball indoors. The staff handled the situation pretty well actually. They hand soaked and air dryed the room while we were out and the room looked handy dandy when we returned that night.\n\nBeing a fairly rowdy group, being loud was a given. Things got a little wierd for us two days in. Our room was the first room on the hall we were in, and they actually had a person standing by our room 24/7. I asked why was this necessary, but the staff all told me they were doing what they were told by the relief and higher class. I'm conviced they were keeping an eye on us.\nThe pool area was exceptional. I mean, it's not a Wet Republic or Cancun, but it's a decent place to lounge around and sun bathe. The music selection was a hit or miss. Some days it was hopping and popping with an actual DJ, and some days it was like they were playing a radio. The drinks are actually really overpriced, but it is Vegas, so you can't really blame them. Anywho, the crowd here was pretty [[laid]] back and it was pretty obvious that everyone was hungover. We had brought a handle of Jameson down with us and had our own personal bar going. This goes against the rules, and the staff gave us a warning, but didn't confiscate the bottle until the second warning, when the bottle was already finished. We had forgotten our swimming wear back in the room, and made the executive decision to jump into the pool in our boxers. We weren't escorted out of the pool area, so i'm assuming this is okay if anyone considers this in the future.\n\nThe tables here are cursed, and do not pay out. Go somewhere else. No, but seriously, I had the worst luck on the tables. The cocktail waitresses returned fairly quickly with the water down drinks, and do not return to you if you don't tip them well. \n\nThe restauraunt selection here isn't the best. They have one place here open 24 hours that serves food that any late night diner would. We ate here a couple early mornings, and the food is as good as any drunk person looking for a quick bite would expect. The staff at the said restaurant were a hit and miss. Some were cooperative while others gave us the evil eye. My buddy and I came here one morning after a night of painting the town red, and we actually fell asleep after we ordered our food. After miserably failing to wake us up, the staff stored our food away until we woke up. No, they didn't remake our food, but instead saved it for us. I would've said something to them about giving us food that was not fresh, but during my sleep, I actually lost my phone and one of the employees here found my phone on the floor and returned it to me once I woke up. A truly sincere gesture when in Sin City. The food wasn't that good by the way.\n\nI felt bad for the maid that was in charge of cleaning our room. The pad looked like a tornado flew through it. After the second day I started tipping any houskeeper that passed by our room and showering them with compliments. It was the least I could do. Our room was always clean after we returned from the daily escapades, with the linen being fully stocked and our bathroom presentably clean. Nothing was stolen or taken either. \n\nWe ordered room service to go along with our pregame on one of the nights when we were getting ready. Aside from the aggressive lady that yelled at us because we took to long to order, the food was extroadinary. We ordered a bunch of finger food that cost us an arm and leg, but everyone was neatly wrapped and to my surprise, well prepared and cooked. \n\nLast but not least, the people in charge of customer service. We had initially asked for a room with a view of the strip, but we also really wanted a smoking room to hot box, but to our dismay, the only smoking room they had, did not have a strip view. So we ended up settling for the view of the not so infamous Trump Tower. My buddy who had initially booked the room, called customer service intoxicated, mind you. He complained to them about the hotel view we had and gave them a bogus story about how he was going to propose tomorrow night and needed a strip view. After speaking to many people he finally had a word with the manager who actually gave us a brand new penthouse with a strip view for our last day there. These people really made our trip memorable and cooperated with all our needs. \n\nI'm giving this place 4 stars because their are better places to stay at on the strip, but if you're not really trying to go all, this is not a bad hotel. It's also right next to the Wynn and Palazzo.

This business is BREAKING THE LAW by refusing service to same gender couples who want to legally marry in the state of Nevada. This business has a business license which legally requires it to offer the service they provide to ANYONE.

Drove into Pittsburgh really late at night. So late the city had pretty much shut up shop. Walked around Station Square for literally an hour passing this place three times before finally having lost all sense of reason and succumbed to the kitsch seafood decor, flying shark with mardi-gras beads in its mouth and party lights. I am allergic to crab but thought hey you only live once right?! and ordered the lobster and king crab steam pot from the extra super buff teenage waiter whose shirt was so tight I could not understand how he could carry around a tray full of food. He was pleasant enough and although the place was practically empty he was never around when I wanted him and always around asking if I needed anything while I was stuffing my face full of sea creatures. The steampot was fine but the whole box of spices they add to it completely [[ruin]] the dish and I shudder to think they try to do that to hide how not-so-fresh the seafood is..[[ugh]]..Well I didn't have my face in a toilet or have exploding diarrhoea after or die from sea creature poisoning so there's a plus. The prices are really high for what they serve but Pittsburgh is pretty far from the ocean. On the plus side I love trains and you can sit right next to the train line and not even hear them pass every 20mins. Also the view across to the city is amazing across the river framed by the monumental massive amount of bridges and you are literally steps from the funicular to walk off your dinner. So whats the lesser of two evils this place or the Hard Rock Crappe next door?

I really try and support local hardware retailers (granted this isn't local, but it's not \""big box\"") as I worked at a small chain back in school.  However I cringe when I have to go here, the staff hasn't been too friendly to me.\n\nI ordered something online and for the longest time the tracking simply said the item had been shipped, meanwhile I ordered something via Home Depot after ACE and it came before!  It seemed like the error was the store received the product but never scanned it in, thus I thought it was still in transit.\n\nThe past 2 times I've gone there, 15-20 min before closing, the employees are huddled at the front of the store and immediately ask me what I'm looking (in not the nicest tone) for because they close soon.  It just seems very pushy, as I'll go to Home Depot or Lowes 5 min before closing and I don't get asked.\n\nI most likely would have bought more items if I didn't feel like they wanted to shut up shop early for the night.  I'll continue to go here for items on my way home, but not for my main hardware needs.

It is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out.\n\nOn to the food.  Started with the 1/2 and 1/2 dinner salad.  The Italian dressing was just [[ok]] for me, but there was nothing wrong with it.  The 1/2 of spinach was non existent.  The pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed.  My biggest complaint about the pie was the sweet sauce.  So sweet in fact that I had to add salt to try to cut the sweetness.  Defiantly not my favorite pie.

Linda is AMAZING, not only is she an amazing person but she is also awesome at scar revisions.  I have a dog bite scar from 1996 that went all the way to the bone that I am self-conscious about.  I saw a crazy deal on Living Social for skin needling, WHAT??? I had no idea what that even was but after talking to Linda on the phone for 20 minutes I felt confident that she could help, at least, make the scar less noticeable. She never made promises that I felt like she could not keep, as in, she said it would be invisible or it would disappear, etc.  We are talking about a deep, old scar.  However, my scar looks AMAZING after 4 treatments.  It is flat, smaller and the discoloration is on the way to being gone.  I am beyond impressed with how it looks. I AM THRILLED! I get comments all the time from people that know me and say \""Is there something different?\"", it's crazy!!!\nNow that we have covered the skin needling, let's talk about the other services Linda offers.  Along with the skin needling that Linda performed, she [[treated]] my whole face to make sure my scar treatment was getting the best chance to work.  Skin scraping and all over face treatment.

[[I]] [[like]] that you can eat in groups, as a couple, or solo with their IHOP-style booths (it looks like an old IHOP inside, and there were a couple of leftover IHOP logos on their window coverings). There were plenty of chef specials to choose from; I hope to try the chef's Crisp Basil Tofu another time. There was a TV for viewing in one corner of the restaurant. It seems very family-friendly, with high chairs and booster seats for the kiddos. They've even got a few toys on hand in case the kids need them for a bit. :) Bathroom was clean with a baby changing station in it. The service was great, friendly and fast. I'm [[definitely]] [[coming]] [[back]] to try other Thai [[favorites]], like their Green Curry!

The food and menu were very good. Decent portions but not overwhelmingly large. Definitely not your [[average]] restaurant. There are only a few tables, most of the seating is at four 25 foot long tables. Also no menu's, everything is written in chalk up on the wall which I personally didn't care for but it was original...kinda. Anyway I will [[return]]. Service was good, parking was easy. Good place to go.

Malmaison (bad house) is about right, but MerdeMaison is much more fitting.  I was really looking forward to spending NYE in Edinburgh and thought this hotel would round out a fun holiday.  How wrong I was.  \n\nAt first glance, the place looks impressive with quirky, fun decor. But it's all about the details, isn't it?  While the room was well furnished and large, the phone didn't work at all through the entire stay (and nobody came to fix it after maintenance made an appearance on day 1). So every time we needed anything, we had to go down to the front desk (see detail on staff attitude later in this review).  In addition, the beds were like wooden planks. \n\nAnd the breakfast was AWFUL.  Food two of the days was only partially cooked and inedible.  I'd upgraded our initial rate to include a full breakfast as part of a NYE package -- the upgrade cost about $100 US for two guests for three days.  But when we got to the cafe we were told our package only included the continental choice and we'd have to pay extra for additional items.  Seriously ... that is expensive bread and pastry (which I don't even eat).  So the desk manager (I assume that was his title), after a discussion, told me he was only upgrading our breakfast package to include meat to keep me happy (delivered in a very snide tone and smirk -- complete with eye roll).\n\nWhich brings us to the hotel staff.  Most importantly to me, about 50 percent of staff was extremely rude -- beyond the norm of European travel. I can tolerate a little bit of sassy attitude, but this was shockingly insulting.\n\nLastly, I'd paid in full two months in advance of the stay only to be presented a bill for 10 percent more at checkout. The girl at the desk could not explain it, only point to line items and shrug.  I'm still not sure why I was charged the additional fee (probably a malicious mark-up for the inedible breakfast) ... I'll probably never know.\n\nI should have followed my instincts initially and booked the Balmoral.  Much more spendy, but worth every single penny.  \n\nI will NEVER again stay at a MerdeMaison property.  But as I don't think the Malmaison brand can possibly last with this type of service, hopefully nobody will have to.

We were really hoping this would be a great place.  It may be, but unfortunately, they forgot our order and we sat in a mostly empty restaurant for about 45 minutes wondering what happened to our sandwiches.  Ended up leaving hungry because we couldn't stay any longer.  They did credit us back for the entire meal, so that was good.  Maybe we'll try again??

Truffle fries, gourmet burgers, hints of Asian fusion here and there, and food served on plates with four corners.  This is enough to make some people thrilled about a restaurant already.  However, when everybody else seems to be doing the the same thing, each one needs to stand out in some way.  Rusconi's didn't.\n\nTHE GIST: Modern American menu / Inconsistent seasoning / Service needs work\n\nFOOD HIGHLIGHTS\n\nGoat Cheese Fondue with Pita Bread: The fondue was [[good]], the pita bread [[used]] to dip it was not.  Our first batch had lukewarm pita bread that had a chewy, dare-I-say microwaved consistency.  After our table finished the first round of pita bread, they were kind enough to offer a second; this batch came out burnt, but this time with a sitting-on-the-counter-too-long consistency.\n\nCheeseburger with Fries: Several members of my party ordered this one, one of them asking for no salt on the fries.  Everybody else [[got]] crunchy, but very salty fries.  [[Her]] [[order]] [[seemed]] to have a [[batch]] of unsalted fries sitting atop a batch of salted fries, because there was definitely salt at the bottom of her bowl.  The burger itself was unremarkable.\n\nOssobuco: This was the special for the night.  Unlike the fries, it was incredibly under-seasoned and rather [[dry]].  I got it to taste a bit better with some salt, but [[dry]] ossobuco is pretty hard to get through as is.  Not recommended.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt's trendy, it's big, and it's American, but there are too many places pulling this concept off correctly for me to recommend this to anyone.

Unless you're true mountaineer requiring constant hydration with a Camelbak, a track bag + water bottle is sufficient. \n\nDon't bother bringing a jacket, it too will be a nascence, do some jumping jacks before you head out and you'll be toasty. \n\nIt is only a 4 [[stars]] because it is incredibly busy and parking is terrible.  Thankfully there's Park N hike, costing you  5 dollars.  Park at the  Town of Paradise Valley off Lincoln and Invergordon.  Its a good option for peeps not from the area, so you can get some nice local advice on trails.  Plus you can get a banana to prevent them cramps.\n\nFor peeps looking for a fun date, spot, consider going up the Cholla side and parking on the street.  If one of you is not too fit, the Echo trek will be miserable for you both.  \n\nI plan to make my millions zip lining peeps from the top to the bottom.  Snapping your ankles on the downward descent could replaced with a [[soul]] crushing 2700 foot drop.  \n\nNote apparently the Echo parking will be closed after January 12ish 2013, to add  more parking.  I have no idea where to park at that time.

The nearest metro stop is about two blocks away--if that.\n\nThe service was wonderful. The front desk people were all very friendly, helpful and speak both english and french. Breakfast is delivered to your door- but you have to make sure to request a delivery time at the front desk. There is a *tiny* parking lot in the back and it is free.

At the base of the movie theater Esplande, sits the PERFECT cocktail Lounge/Patio for summer.  That Lounge/patio rises above the Biltmore shops at 24th Street and Camelback with the perfect north-facing Mountain views.  The kicker part about it, the misting system is SUPER cooling and SUPER awesome.  They outdoor lounge has comfy sofas and a bar serving crafted cocktails.  I went here this summer for vibes and libations with friends.\n\nHappy Birthday Del Frisco's!   I had the most wonderful time at Del Frisco's for their 1 year birthday.  It was a scorching 115+ degrees that day and I'm not sure what made me think it would be ok to hang out outside in their outdoor lounge.  It was hot in the moments before the sun went down, but once that sun went down, their super misters seemed to kick it into high gear and it was extremely comfortable up there. \n\nMy friends and I hung out in their well misted outdoor lounge.  A local band played exciting and entertaining soulful music for the anniversary.  There was dancing... I like to dance.  I danced.  I laughed and I danced some more.\n\nI ordered my favorite DFG cocktail.  I'm totally into spicy crafted cocktails and DFG has a decent spicy drink.  Every girl loves a \""hottie\"" and Del Frisco has one of those too.... the Biltmore Hottie (Rum, simple syrup, jalapeno and lime)...  That hottie is something special.  A must try if you enjoy spicy drinks.\n\nThank goodness for DFG.  I have a great place to sip cockails while overlooking Camelback Mountain.  Try it, YOu will love it too.

Hopefully you never get Erica as a server. She was very rude, rushed, and does not know the golden rule. She argues when questioned. I think because we all look younger she thought we wouldn't tip well, her mistake. \nWILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS CHILIES!

[[The]] waiter we had was terrible, for a high class steak house I was very surprised, he mumbled the whole time and we couldn't hear anything he said. The apps are pricey but the tomatoes were amazing and apps and sides are big enough to share. Each member of our party had a different steak and we all thought it was amazing. My medium-rare filet was cooked perfectly and incredibly smooth. I found it to be a bit overpriced but at least good food. Decor was beautiful.

I got the philly cheese steak.  The bread was decent, but that was about all that was decent.   The steak was roast beef heated up.  The bell peppers were mushy and there was hardly any flavor to the sandwich.  I would much rather have gone to subway.  I would not go back again.

I would AVOID this BUG ridden place!! They are not only dirty but they can not get your order right. They made me late to work and then when I called to tell them that they gave me the wrong bagel, I was told it was my problem. Nice isn't it? They have a high counter so you can't see what they are doing behind the counter. AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!!! Its over priced and just gross!!

Where do I begin? Oh yes, the bar \""losing our order\"", what a great start. \nThis was followed by the landslide. \n-Hostess takes us to a table, only to immediately take us to a \""better table\"". \n-Sit at the \""better table\"" for 20 minutes without service. \n-I go to the hostess stand to ask if we have a waiter, she apologizes and assures me a manager will be with me immediately. We were there for an hour and 45 minutes total, the manager never arrived. \n-Our second attempt at ordering drinks fell flat. Third time worked. \n-Had to stop a different waiter to get a wine menu that our waiter was coming right back with, 20 minutes earlier. \n\nTo the food:\n-3 of 4 steaks were grossly overcooked. \n-Lobster bisque was bland.\n-Salads were mediocre, at best. \n-Asparagus was good, but that's easy. \n\nIn all, everyone at the table agreed this was the worst restaurant experience any of us have had. Very disappointing as a close friend that is a major foodie described it as a \""life changing meal\"" for him. I guess technically it was for me too, just not in a good way.  I'm appalled that we spent more PER dish than an entire meal for four at the likes of Outback Steakhouse and left wishing we had gone to Outback Steakhouse. \n\nI will stick to Les Artistes Steakhouse when in Vegas. \n\nThanks for a horrible ending to our fabulous wedding day.

I had the luxury to have a  week stay here last August , the grounds here are green and  flawless , my room was very modern with a comfortable bed, down pillows and a huge flat screen TVs to veg-out  too - great for  avoiding the Arizona heat. The view out of  my room was of one of the many Baltimore's  pools where you could see people throughout the day ordering drinks and laying out and soaking up the rays where one can only imagine the famous past of the Baltimore's guest of yesterdays. The main pool has classic views all around of \""Wright\"" iconic architecture -it even has a water slide for kids and adults to enjoy. The staff was [[polite]] to the point that i became embarrassed after a week's stay. The food at the Wright Bar was great - [[best]] duck I have ever come cross to date. If you have a chance sign up for the mountain bike ride that takes you through some fun and scary Arizona trails. The gym facilities need some updating but the locker room area are of spa quality - plenty of Bumble & Bumble for your hair.

This is a bit inconvenient for me as I prefer the grab and go style quickie breakfast. \n\nWhen I drop in for a quick lunch/dinner, I always go for the \""you pick two\"" option because I can never decide between soup or sandwich/panini.

I go back to show him that there was more then one and it showed the price for 18.99. He replies \""that's for another brand and I'm not giving it to you for that price\"" Could he have been any more ruder.

I went to Cute Nails over the weekend. It was my third nail salon that I have frequented in the Charlotte area. This place paled in comparison to the other two. It was a decent environment inside. The pedicure I got was only $25 which is a good price. As someone else mentioned, the water was very hot. The chairs are old and not very effective at massaging. My chair cut off after about five minutes and would not go back on. I am also used to a foot massage/leg massage as part of my typical pedicure experience. She did not do this, but she did punch my feet a few times each. That was a little out of what I am used to. She did scrape off my dead skin, but she did it very lightly and left more skin on than I prefer. I am missing some nail polish on the corners of my nails. They are also cut kind of crooked. My eyebrow waxing experience wasn't so great either. She did not shut the door and had kind of unpleasant bedside manner. My left eyebrow had a little hole from where she plucked too many hairs out. I don't imagine being back. People who worked there were nice though.

They are efficient with your time spent in the store in mind. \n\n~The Bad~\nAlthough they are still marked down, the shoe selection is still pricey. I do not suggest buying the shoes, you can go online or to a shoe store to get better deals. Maybe try on the shoes you are looking for, but put them back and save your money. The jeans are also pretty expensive. I am not a jeans guy, so the dollar amounts for the jeans seemed excessive. I am pretty sure I can get the same quality jeans for a quarter of the price somewhere else. I obviously can't vouche for the womens side, they have a ton... so no comment there. That really covers it, not too bad if you ask me.\n\n~The Down Low~\nAll this said, there are many places to get marked down clothes at. I did my homework, the prices here beat markdowns online and even on E-bay for my Penguin brand. The same goes for a lot of brands, I am sure. For designer styles at marked down prices, this is the perfect spot, and its so close to my place.

Wife an I was there last night, the band was playing they were so so, but the people that were there were dancing and having fun...So we thought this looked like a fun place.. We had a couple drinks, 8.00 for exactly\n1 oz of white tequila... An appetizer Mussels was OK a little to much Basil for my liking... I had the stake with a mushroom sauce... It looked good when it was placed in front of me, I noticed how small the stake looked so I assumed I was going to get a meal that tasted great... My 1st bite I was very disappointed it was very blan tasting had to ask the waiter for salt and pepper, none being on the table, just to add some flavor to this meal, but I ate it because I was hungry... My wife had a shrimp and scallop pasta dish that came on a small plate, even the shrimp and scallops were only about the size of a nickel... The prices did not reflect the quality or the quantity of  the meal... The waiter was nice but the food was sub-par at most... We will not be back...

So this means no real refills.   Most of the \""hot\"" food was warm, some just cold.  We went in at dinner time 7:30pm.\n\nAfter trying to eat the made to order pasta with red sauce tasted like I have no way to describe it but enough to make you puke.   Several items were bad on the buffet.  My whole party got sick, and we all spent night and morning in the bathroom in our hotel.   I think this buffet should be shut down!!!\n\nWe will be sending a letter to the hotel, and the state health department.\n\nI will NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!  WE COULD BE GIVEN FREE PASSES FOR LIFE AND WOULD NOT EAT THERE.  I WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE THEM TO A HOMELESS PERSON!

I was fortunate to have business meetings at the Wynn this past week and made it a point to have lunch at La Cave as I had [[heard]] great things. [[And]] I was definitely impressed. La Cave, known for their small plates, flatbreads and extensive wine list, was simply [[amazing]]! I dined with 2 colleagues and ordered 5 plates, which was more than enough to share. I will review in the order we received our food, starting with the mushroom grits which were to die for! I don't believe I had ever had grits before and my first experience eating them was [[amazing]]. The grits are served with the mushrooms, pecorino cheese and butter on top and after mixing everything in, each bite I took was absolutely delicious. Next up was the salt-roasted beets, topped with goat cheese and pistachios. Every beet salad I've had in the past is [[usually]] served cold, whereas the beets I enjoyed at La Cave were warm and fresh. Shortly thereafter came the bacon-wrapped dates which were also out of this [[world]]. Our chorizo & sausage flatbread came next which was a very [[generous]] serving. The flatbread was unlike any other with the unique toppings served here. Finally, we had ordered the stuffed chicken and that is the only dish I wouldn't highly recommend. While not bad, it was just chicken with no unique touches. All in all, I am so [[glad]] I was able to dine at La Cave and will [[definitely]] [[return]] upon my next trip to Vegas.

Who still buys books anymore?\nAnd who in their right mind wants to read one in Las Vegas when you can be doing so much more?\n\n*lowly raising hand*\n\nI like books and have delusions of finding rare literature at some random bookstore.\nAnywho, we were at Trader Joe's when I noticed this place, and since I wanted something to read, I thought I'd give this place a chance.\n\nWe were greeted by a nice couple who directed us to the fiction section.\nThe place reminded more of my library in grade school than it did a bookstore. \nNo luck on finding any interesting fiction to read and no rare books, but I did find plenty of Danielle Steele novels.\nAren't I lucky?\n\nOverall, I think I'll just visit the library out here.

Had a business lunch there today, and definitely will not be returning for the food. I heard whispers about town that the food at this Vig was going to be better than their other locations. So, I was excited to give this one a shot, as I have totally given up on their other locations for anything other than drinks, and light snacks.\n\nThe outside eating area and bar are just perfect for the fall weather. The design is simple, cohesive, friendly & warm. The praise stops there.\n\nWe ordered chips & guac. The chips tasted like they were fried in old oil, and the guac had a flavor that certainly wasn't guac-licious... more on the verge of going bad. \n\nOne person joining us had the deconstructed tacos, which she barely touched, as the fish was more like fish jerky, and the side of beans totally tasteless. I shared the \""best turkey sandwich\"" with someone, and had high expectations with a name like that. It was a soggy mess of flavors. None of the ingredients stuck out, and it quickly fell apart after the first bite. \n\nNothing was exceptional. Sort of bummed by the experience, but at least it will be a fun place to grab a beer on a lovely fall evening.

Hey there goes Louis Vuitton! Ooooh, Prada! Hello there, Gucci! Wait a minute, aren't there like several other locations of these stores within a 3 mile radius of this place? \n\nThere's not really a single accessible store or restaurant in here, and to make it worse, many of the stores in this \""new\"" mall have already existed on The Strip for more than 10 years. With how hard they were trying to make this place \""different\"" you would think they would have brought in something new to the table. For what it's worth, there are some very interesting architectural details and public artwork within this mall worth seeing at least once (I really liked the glowing trees, okay they weren't exactly glowing but I'm not sure how else to describe them), but that doesn't make me any more interested in browsing at a Gucci store when I can just browse at one down the street. \n\nExcuse me while I go down to the Fashion Show or the Forum Shops, browse in the super upscale stores I can't afford but can still manage to buy something at a more reasonable store anyway. At least those two malls don't completely reek of pretension and feel closer to the real world if you know what I mean.

We came here for lunch last week.  We had a coupon we had purchased online and thought we'd try this place.  The visit started off badly when we arrived at the place and there was a handwritten sign saying that \""All Groupons must have reservations\"", with a phone number listed.  So, we stood outside in the 100 degree Las Vegas heat and called for a reservation.  We were asked when we wanted to eat and my wife told them, we are standing outside and are here for lunch.  They told her the manager wasn't there and could we call a different phone number and talk to the manager?  So, we did.  Again, my wife asked if we could make a \""reservation\"" and told the person on the phone that we were here for lunch.  He said is would be over in about 15 minutes.  Say what?  Not sure what his presence at the restaurant had to do with us eating lunch.  My wife asked, \""Can we go inside and order\"".  Yes, you may.  Sheesh! \n\nSo, in we [[went]].  [[A]] [[nice]] [[lady]] [[promptly]] [[seated]] us as we were the only customers there as lunch time (a bad sign?).  We ordered a la carte sushi from the \""Groupon Menu\"", huh?! We were quickly given water to drink.  About 10 minutes after we ordered, a young man showed up at our table with headphones on.  The manager perhaps?  Not sure, he didn't introduce himself, but he wanted to know about our coupon.  He took the coupon.\n\nSo, after all of that, the sushi came out.  It seemed decent actually, but who wants to go through all of that to order a few sushi rolls?  This place will likely close within a couple of months due to bad reputation and no business.\n\nI feel bad for the waitress as she seemed nice and polite.\n\nI definitely would not [[come]] [[back]].

First off, the one star is a reflection upon food quality and taste. The service was okay and the server was nice.\n\nThe food presentation was good (please see pictures). The food looked appetizing but failed to have any taste.\n\nWe had the players that are recommended for first timers as we wanted to sample the variety of foods they had. It was bland and and lacked true flavoring of Indian cuisine. I was really disappointed with their lassi despite of ordering a sweet lassi it was salty and the herbs overpowered the drink.\n\nThe food was overpriced. I don't think I would come back unless they change the cook and make proper lassi. \n\nBottom line: A tourist attraction with iron elephants in the front to trick you into going in. Not worth the price.

Absolutely terrible. The overweight, ugly, disgusting 'manager' of the store - I couldn't tell if it was a man or a woman - sees that my check engine and ABS lights are on because my sensor chip in my car is messed up (note: The car is just fine. I take it to a mechanic every 3 months or less), and STILL charges me $20 without even conducting the full test. In fact, she knows it's going to fail the whole time and does it anyways.  This place is a scam and this location in particular - I'm filing complaints with all of the offices, both written and verbal (ADEQ) and I hope that this location in particular is shut down and that the 'manager' (who didn't wear a name tag, which is either out of shame or the sure sign of a scam) is FIRED.\n\nPrivate functions need to replace all State functions within the next 5 years.

When I eat at a Ruth's Chris, I've come to expect excellent food and even better service.  My experience at this location, however, did not meet my expectations.\n\nIt's located in a strip mall so the parking was convenient, but the fa\u00e7ade was not very impressive.  Our party of 6 came in a bit staggered and our half was not greeted by anyone, instead we had to find our way to the table where the rest of our party was seated.\n\nThe waitress was friendly, but gave the \""welcome to Ruth's Chris\"" spiel with the enthusiasm of an airline stewardess explaining how to put on a life jacket in the event of a water landing.\n\nI ordered the Crabatini which was excellent.  A friend of mine ordered the calamari for the table, though, and it seemed like someone pulled the squid out and just fried up the breading.  It also really needed a remoulade or some kind of sauce to dip the fried bits into.  \n\nShortly before our steaks arrived, an overly gruff and visibly uncomfortable server's assistant arrived to direct us to avoid touching the plates as they are 500 degrees and to hold our napkins up so we don't get splattered with the sizzling butter our steaks would be bathing in.  My ribeye steak and the rest of our party's filets arrived.  After taking my first bite, I thought, where is all of the sizzling butter I was warned about and craved?  The steak was good, but just not as great as all of the other times I've been.  My side of sweet potato casserole was as delicious as I remember though.\n\nAfter finishing about  1/2 of my ribeye and settling into a meat coma, I realized that my mild irritation with the dining experience was not being helped by the view of the other servers loafing and leaning against the front counter or the excessively hot temperature in the room.  It is Vegas in the summer time; it is alright to crank the air conditioning up!  There was no dessert for me; I just wanted to flee the scene.  \n\nI am sure I'm being overly critical but Ruth's Chris is [[supposed]] to be a [[top]] [[notch]] [[steak]] house with superb [[service]].  Other [[times]] I've [[visited]] rated 4.5 to 5 stars; maybe this location just needs some new management.   \n\nI will return, but just not to this location.

This was such 50/50 place. Out of three different specialty pizzas we ordered, one was really good, one was okay and the other was really bad. Salad was good, but nothing special. Ranch dressing was really good, bleu cheese dressing was really bad. Chicken tenders were burnt, like to the point that when I opened the container, it smelled like a kitchen was on fire. They were so black, I could not believe that they actually delivered those to us. The buffalo sauce was good, but useless since our chicken was not eatible. The baked potato fries were a good concept and had a good flavor, but the fries were soggy, but maybe that was just because they were delivered. Okay, maybe it was less than a 50/50 ratio here, since we did spend over $100 for so much dissapointment.

I liked the decor and atmosphere a lot.  It was loud, but lively and warm. We didn't have a reservation, so we got seated in what turned out to be not such a great table.  It was really close to the bar.  Our server-- who was very nice and clearly well-trained-- tried to make some room, but we just sat on the same side.  \n\n\nCocktails were fine.  You can tell they're trying hard, but the results were nothing to write home about.\n\nCheese curds were good-- I would say above average, with a nice light batter.\n\nMy wife ordered scallops, which were served with swiss chard and some nice crusty bread ($26).  This included three scallops (medium-large, but not enormous).  The sauce really added nothing to them.  Not a bad dish, but really kind of bland and boring.  My wife thought that they were tasty but overpowered by salt.  I thought that they were just boring.\n\nI had the pappardelle ($19).  To be honest, it kind of sucked.  The proportions were off (oddly enough, not enough pasta and too much sauce) and the sausage that they were using seemed to be high-quality, but ill suited for the dish.  It was bland when it needed to be robust.  It came with what seemed to be  a huge ball of ricotta, but it seemed to just melt in and away quickly, adding very little to the dish.  On the whole, this dish  really could have used some more flavor, if even just some more salt.  \n\nSo, in sum, an utterly mediocre and forgettable meal for far too much money (total with three drinks and tip was just under $100).\n\nI highly doubt we'll be back.

I went here because of John Cusack!\n\nNo idea there was a Serendipty in Vegas, but I'm super [[glad]] there is. \n\nAnd even though tall, dark, and handsome wasn't there, the famous frozen hot chocolate was. I'm so happy it wasn't over-hyped. Tasted like ... creamy, slushy Ovaltine. With real whip [[cream]]. If I had enough room, I would've wanted another one. \n\nIt's way expensive ($16.50 for a burger!), but it's Vegas. [[At]] least the portions are HUGE. The boy ordered the steak sandwich and it was as long as his arm (it was really [[good]], too). I had the uber juicy burger with avocado, brie (my favorite cheese on a burger - you don't see it often as an option), and caramelized onions. The onion rings were [[crispy]] and the batter was tasty, but I didn't think it went with the parmesan that was dusted on top. Big con was that the french fries were OVERLY salted. AND because it was sea salt there were huge chunks of salt everywhere. \n\nThe outdoor area is nice, the indoors is fun and flirty, and the fried oreos are ... sin. Try one.

I didn't have to wait as I went straight to the bar to sit. The noise level is a little loud with techno type music playing. This is a little random but the silverware was bulky and hard to use. \n\nI ordered 1 scrambled egg. Side of hash browns. Soyrizo. Tortilla. Coffee. The total was $11.37. The egg was cooked well and the hash browns was a healthy portion. However, both were very [[bland]]. I didn't even eat the soyrizo as the spices gave it a horrible taste, so I didn't touch it past the first bite. I'm spoiled by the Trader Joes soyrizo I think. The coffee was also bland, but I drank it because I needed my caffeine. I was never offered a refill or top off. The bartender was prompt enough but no personality.

I didn't have to wait as I went straight to the bar to sit. The noise level is a little loud with techno type music playing. This is a little random but the silverware was bulky and hard to use. \n\nI ordered 1 scrambled egg. Side of hash browns. Soyrizo. Tortilla. Coffee. The total was $11.37. The egg was cooked well and the hash browns was a healthy portion. However, both were very [[innocuous]]. I didn't even eat the soyrizo as the spices gave it a horrible taste, so I didn't touch it past the first bite. I'm spoiled by the Trader Joes soyrizo I think. The coffee was also bland, but I drank it because I needed my caffeine. I was never offered a refill or top off. The bartender was prompt enough but no personality. Never asked how everything was etc. \n\nI've heard so many good things about this place, so I was disappointed. Next time I will try those pancakes everyone talks about, and partake of the bar menu.

I love this place! The staff is very friendly and helpful. My lash artist, Chantel, is AMAZING! I have been a loyal customer for nearly a year now and would recommend it to everyone. Go get a free consultation! It will change your life...just a word of caution: be prepared for constant compliments on your lashes! :)

Leslie does an amazing job every time I go. I have referred her to all my family and friends.  She is always prompt. I never wait past my appointment time, which I appreciate.  The lashes last longer than any other place I have tried, a full three to four weeks.  I never have that weird stingy feeling or any irritation.  It's relaxing, enjoyable, and worth every penny.  I was a mascara addict before, now I just wake up and go!\n\nHighly recommend.

At 1 PM, we were handed large menus with several dozen interesting choices. Only one seafood entree (fish tacos) on the entire 4 pg card was less than $12, and that included soups. I didnt really want to settle for fish tacos in a lauded casa de mariscos.  \n\nEntrees come with complementary ceviche tostadas, which was a nice surprise.  My son had the house specialty,  camerones culuchi, and I tried a flash-fried whitefish, served whole with sides, for 15 bucks.  We agreed the green culuchi sauce bathing six shrimp was instantly [[forgettable]]. My fish had about 150 pin bones and less meat than a small can of tuna fish. That's not an attempt at humor. I can debone a fish and there was less meat on this crispy carcass than a standard 6 oz can of tuna, as if they extracted most of it for their own devices, leaving me with little more than skin, bones and an eyeball.  \n\nIt's hardly a crummy place on the inside - the decor is cute and colorful.  Service seemed friendly, if a bit confused, and having grown up in New England,  I'm aware seafood can be pricey.  That said, after tax and tip, we spent $40 for one meh and one pretty craptastic lunch, in a hole in the wall just south of Roosevelt. \n\nJudging from the other reviews, it sounds like we just came at a bad time, but that doesnt help me get my forty dollars back. [[Two]] stars for the ceviche.

Great little store offering sweets and lots of nostalgia.  Fun shop to pop into.  I found candy (such as salt water taffy and googoo clusters) from my childhood, sweets from the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, even regular \""staples\"" such as Sweet tarts and MaryJanes. \nThey also sell novelty items such as tin signs, pez dispensers and metal lunchboxes.  There is also a nice variety of sugar-free confections.  Prices range from fair to somewhat pricey, but if you're aching to find a sweet that sparks a memory---this is the right spot!  \n\nLocated near UltraStar Theatre, so great spot to pop in and grab something before a movie or to peek in and satisfy that sweet tooth!

Target gets 1 star. And that saddens me. I typically love target. Tonight I went into this super target to get Easter items and a few food items. It was late. This target closes at 9 pm. At 8:45 they started announcing the store was closing at 9, from this point on they announced closing times EVERY two to three minutes, I kid you not. About 5 mins to the hour, I basically had a team me never following or better yet corralling me towards the front of the store, asking what I needed to get. What I needed to find. I was almost to the front and after being told the time was 8:48, 8:51, 8:53, 8:55, 8:58, at 9;00 they shut the lights off but a few. Really?!? Poor taste. Ruined my whole experience. Once I got to the register they could not check me out fast enough and get me out the door. I don't understand how this is acceptable anymore? When I worked retail in my late teens, early twenties, we locked the doors at closing but current clientele could finish up their shopping, and not be reminded every two minutes. For some of us, this is the most convienet time to shop. Target, I might be one, but you will no longer get my dollar.

I went to Professional Brake when my was having a hard time running and my towing would not tow to my normal place because it was to far away. On the way to the shop the tow truck driver warned me about this place, stating that he had heard many horror stories about it. This put me on edge but I was willing to try it out.\n\nI walked in and Jeff was very friendly. There was a guest sitting there waiting for his car. We started talking and he mentioned how these guys had [[ripped]] him off in the past and how he felt it was happening again because he came in for an easy fix that turned out to not be an easy fix. So when they started looking at my car I made sure I was watching what they were doing.\n\nThey quickly found the problem and started looking for the part. They spent a lot of time calling around to try and find the part, finally they found it and gave me a quote. I was satisfied with this and mentioned that my headlights were out and I would like them to be replaced. I left and came back an hour later to get my car.\n\nJeff informed me that my headlights were out because of a major electrical issue and he was going to charge me an extra $30 finders fee for the part for my car. This surprised me because he quoted me after they found the part, the fee should have already been in the quote. I paid and left.\n\nThe next day I took it to my normal place (see my other reviews) and had them double check all of their work and look into the headlights. Their work was sound, but there was nothing wrong with my electrical, my headlights were just out.\n\nIn conclusion: if you decide to go here make sure you keep an eye on your car and if they say that there is an issue that you are unsure of, get a second opinion!

Today was my first time in the store and I was truly impressed with how professional and [[knowledgeable]] Scott was the entire [[time]]. As you would expect when you walk into one of the specialty stores for running shoes (Berkeley Running, Fleet Feet and the likes), Scott started off by asking me about my running frequency, distances, goals etc. Next he had me do a test run on a [[treadmill]] to determine pronation and a foot scan to look at my arches and weight distribution. He would explain the results to you so you gain a little more understanding into your own unique running style. \n\nNext he would bring out 4 - 5 pairs of shoes he thinks would fit you best. And he has a pretty good idea of what would be a good fit. My second pair of shoes fit like a glove. The staff there are very [[patient]], [[staying]] with you as long as it takes for you to find your fit. [[If]] your first impression is anything less than perfect, they [[would]] discourage you from continuing, and give you another pair. Really [[awesome]] level of customer service. \n\nOnce you have found your match, you hop back onto the treadmill for another test run. Just to make sure that everything is still as great as it started out to be!! They were out of the shoes in the color I wanted, but Scott placed an order for me from the warehouse instead of pushing me to get it in another color which was in stock. \n\nAs you can probably sense by now I am super impressed and happy with what I got. I would recommend this store for running, swimming and biking needs. You will walk away with merchandize that will [[truly]] help your [[goals]] [[positively]]. As in other running stores around town they do offer [[discounts]] for various affiliations so just ask the friendly staff.

Maybe it's just me but this store is not up to par in my opinion. I always stop here to get money orders for rent on the way home from work and I almost always have to wait at the counter for 5 or more minutes while employees constantly yell \""someone will be right with you\"" at me from all directions. The sandwich counter is good although it says sandwich in 3 minutes or its free and it always takes longer. (I never say anything because I don't care, I just don't see the point of the sign.) Their meat section is a joke lacking any real selection. The produce is almost always below my quality standards and is also lacking in selection. Last but most definitely not least they always have just one register open and no self checkout. Overall going there is a highly inconveniencing experience and I would not recommend going there for anything.

No thank you. This was the worst service that we've ever received.\n\nDO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!\n\nI REPEAT...\n\nDO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL!!\n\nTHIS IS A HORROR STORY!\n\nWe contacted them about a promotion that we received in the mail. We booked two double-bed rooms over the phone. We were really excited about staying at this new hotel. We had heard that it was beautiful and lively. They gave us great customer service when we called. It sounded so awesome that even my brother and his family wanted to go! They asked if I can call and book one more room.\n\nSo I called and asked to try and see if we can book one more double-bed room. They said they were more than happy to book one more double-bed room! We just had to pay an extra 30$. Great. \""Will the rooms be close to each other?\"" No because the other two rooms are single-bed rooms. Hmmm...that's not what we booked and what the sales girl told me. So they told me that I had to pay an extra 30$ per room for the double bed. Fine. I'll pay it but I am not happy that I was misled to begin with. I want to talk to the girl who gave me the wrong information or her supervisor to file a complaint. If I hadn't called back and added the additional room I would have showed up with 8 adults and 1 infant with two beds only?\n\nWell, nobody ever called me back. Whatever. And I showed up with three parties. But we were informed that...we all had single bed-rooms?\n\nAll double bed-rooms in the hotel are booked. On December 28th? Tuesday? Really?\n\nNow I'm pissed.\n\nI want to raise hell! I want to talk to the manager! I want to talk to the salesperson who signed us up for the room. I want someone to make this right! I want double-beds so we don't have to sleep on the floor. The supervisor in-charge told us to sleep in our room that night and tomorrow they would contact us when rooms opened up.\n\nWell, as you could have guessed that never happened...\n\nI had over 15 people at that hotel! We slept there, ate there, and bathed there. We gambled there. We spent a lot of money there. And all I wanted was for someone to keep their promise and follow through. When I contacted the front office they said they had no record of any complaints and they would call us back if a double-bed room opened up...\n\nI doubt that.\n\nI asked for the general manager's name and they gave me her name and number. Awesome. So I ask a couple of people on the casino floor about the general manager and just kind of want to get an idea of what kind of person she was...\n\nAlison Lopez, General Manager.\n\nThey had never heard of her.\n\nThey had fooled me for what felt like the 100th time. I had NO peace of mind. I will never stay there again. I still am having trouble contacting any kind of management. Nobody can follow-up with their customers. For regular Vegas visitors, we have NEVER felt more disrespected. I'm still trying to contact Alison Lopez...no one knows who she is.\n\nFront desk girl name was Vanessa, second phone salesman was Alan, supervisor was Eva. All terrible and misleading.\n\nPlease do not stay at this hotel. And if you do, just call and verify your information. This was a NIGHTMARE.\n\nBy the way, we did not get any kind of housekeeping over 3 nights here. This was minimal compared to the other problems but still...

[[Lovey]] love love this boutique. Finally checked it out on a First Friday, of all nights, even though I regularly stop at Roosevelt right next door. \nThe clothes are incredibly cute but just too expensive for me to justify buying. Not like Urban Outfitters expensive and cute though - at least this stuff is unique and good quality, so if I had an extra $90 lying around, I would totally buy myself a sweater or shirt or that darling pea green corduroy a-line skirt with the swallow patch. I love the dresses, but a hundy on a dress will have to wait til I get a raise (boo salary freeze/recession). However, the jackets were incredibly reasonably priced, around $100-150 and again, very cut. Men's clothes - not totally my taste, a lot of JT style hats and button down shirts ala martini ranch \""I'm dressed up!\""\nBut, I can afford the jewelry, and oh it is cute, cute, cute. Picked up a five-piece, simple silver toned ring for $6 - yeah, you heard me, $6 - and I get [[compliments]] on it all the [[time]]. Also picked up a nice little silver feather necklace for the sister for xmas and she loved it. The sis had seen one at U.O. or something for like $29, but I got her the one every girl at HH *won't* have for $18. AND, i can say about the men's selection is that I LOVE the hand-screen-printed (can you hand screen print? Does that makes sense) ties ($30)! In bright jewel tones like peacock blue, hot pink and lime green, with awesome prints like an octopus ... or a bicycle.

Not like Urban Outfitters expensive and cute though - at least this stuff is unique and good quality, so if I had an extra $90 lying around, I would totally buy myself a sweater or shirt or that darling pea green corduroy a-line skirt with the swallow patch. I love the dresses, but a hundy on a dress will have to wait til I get a raise (boo salary freeze/recession). However, the jackets were incredibly reasonably priced, around $100-150 and again, very cut. Men's clothes - not totally my taste, a lot of JT style hats and button down shirts ala martini ranch \""I'm dressed up!\""\nBut, I can afford the jewelry, and oh it is cute, cute, cute. Picked up a five-piece, simple silver toned ring for $6 - yeah, you heard me, $6 - and I get [[homage]] on it all the [[dated]]. Also picked up a nice little silver feather necklace for the sister for xmas and she loved it. The sis had seen one at U.O. or something for like $29, but I got her the one every girl at HH *won't* have for $18. AND, i can say about the men's selection is that I LOVE the hand-screen-printed (can you hand screen print? Does that makes sense) ties ($30)! In bright jewel tones like peacock blue, hot pink and lime green, with awesome prints like an octopus ... or a bicycle. Bought one for the BF for [[carolers]] and gave it to him early so he could wear it at his friend's xmas party and it was a [[overpowering]]! Very [[alone]] and incredibly [[stylized]] - and I'm a [[earning]] cause I'm the cool ass GF that got it for him. \nEverybody wins!!!\nI was going to give [[two]] stars, but how [[coldest]] is shopping before hh at the Roosevelt? I'll tell you - very effin' [[cold]]. Another [[reputation]] and BB is outta this [[tierra]]! Ow!

I've been coming here for the past few years and it's [[still]] one of my [[favorites]].\n\nHikari is one of the [[best]] AYCE places in Las Vegas for sushi.  While the actual list of items on their AYCE may not initially seem like a lot, I dare you to work your way down the list.  Unlike many other sushi bars that offer AYCE deals, Hikari has both Uni and Oysters on it's AYCE list.  Also, sashimi is offered as part of the AYCE which is almost NEVER available.\n\nMy best suggestion is to sit at the sushi bar as the service is quicker and you can get to know the staff.  They'll try to help guide you along if you're not an experienced sushi eater.  Just ask! :)

Wow. I can't believe this place has gotten such good reviews. The place was a mess.\n\nMy friends and I came here for breakfast this morning and didn't even get water for the first 10-15 mins we were seated. I don't know if this is normal or what but I don't consider that good service. We waited at least 30 minutes to be seated plus another 15 just for our order to be taken.\n\nThe food was good but just as good as any diner I've been to before, including Denny's. I will definitely not be coming back.\n\nNot only did we wait to be seated and waited for our drinks, we also waited in line for about 20 minutes just to pay the bill. The host was a silver haired woman that was so rude and asked us to move multiple times while we were waiting to pay our bill.\n\nI just don't understand why everyone likes them. The only people I saw in there were 50-60something year old tourists that were probably staying at one of the nearby hotels and didn't realize there were other options nearby.\n Like I said, we won't be coming back again.

I like domino's pizza when I just want to have cheap pizza delivered.  This location however is awful.  They have messed up the last 3 orders.  1, the crust was missing its seasoning completely and the cheese was half missing - what?  2. the order arrives well over 30 minutes late and wasn't piping hot like you expect.  When i called to check on my tardy order, the manager Carla was rude and told me \""not to worry about it.\"" What again?  3. I ordered a hand tossed, to hopefully get the garlicky crust I missed out on previously, and they delivered a pan pizza 10 minutes late.  How does one make the online order THAT wrong?  It prints out.  There are only so many crust options.  Carla was rude this time too - if you mess up okay, but don't make it worse by treating your already frustrated paying customer like crap.

My girlfriend and I went to this Public Urban Bar (come on guys, just call it a pub) after reading Matt C's glowing review on here, mostly because the lure of nickel PBR's could not be ignored forever.\n\nAfter finally figuring out how to get into the damn place, we took our seats and ate some food (and drank some real beer) until 9PM, when the PBR party officially started.\n\nI tried the roast beef sliders, which were about as tasty as the roast beef sandwiches at Arby's. That is, worth about three bucks. They couldn't be simpler, either. Roughly four inches of roast beef between two buns with (I think) some sort of aioli thrown in so it at least has some sort of flavor. I love roast beef as much as the next guy, but these sliders were just too much. These suckers cost me thirteen smackers, which they are definitely not worth. The nickel beers (if you can call PBR beer) were definitely nice, but the [[mediocrity]] of my meal [[stuck]] with me.\n\nI'm not going to get into details about my adventure today trying to recover the debit card I left at the P.U.B. last night, but let me give you a piece of advice: Never deal with the City Center security / lost and found department if you can avoid it. I'm pretty sure it's the entire staff's first day, every day.\n\nBetween the moderate inaccessibility compared to other pubs in town, the extremely high prices on everything (seriously, nine bucks for a Blue Moon?), and the unremarkable food, I can't recommend this place unless you've got friends who really insist on meeting up there -- or you go on a Tuesday night for some really cheap (in multiple senses) beer. I hear the actual burgers are actually quite good though, so maybe I'll try one soon. I'll have to save up for a while first, though.

I bought a Groupon to go try Mabuhay Philippine Cuisine, and The Wife and I finally went to use it for dinner this past Saturday. We had heard good-ish reviews for Mabuhay, and were excited to try a new style of food. Unfortunately, the whole experience, from start to finish, ended up being terrible, which led us to give the restaurant the nickname of \""Mabu-bye.\"" We actually walked out of the restaurant before we had even taken a single bite of food, but, lest you think I'm being unfair in this review, please read the whole thing.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a small strip mall along S Park Street, which wasn't a big deal to us because some of our favorite restaurants have been located in strip malls. Our first warning of things to come should have been that there was only one other car parked in the lot at 6:00 pm on a Saturday evening, but we walked in anyway. Upon entering the restaurant, we discovered that there was no one at the cash register, and no indication of whether to seat ourselves or wait for someone to seat us. We saw one waiter running around getting drinks for the 3 tables that were eating, but he never once looked at us. After standing awkwardly in the entrance for a few minutes, we decided to just sit down at a table, at which point a woman who had been sitting and eating at one of the other tables got up and said, \""Yes, wherever you want.\"" Well, that would've been helpful a few minutes ago!\n\nSo, we sat down at a table, and the waiter came over another few minutes later to ask if we wanted drinks. Both The Wife and I ordered water, which he brought out, but  it was lukewarm (no ice at all) and the glasses were barely 3/4 full. He then walked away without saying a word about ordering food.\n\nNow, going in, we knew that the food would be served buffet style, but the waiter did not say whether we could just go up to the buffet or whether he would bring us plates to use first. So, I got up and went to look at the buffet. I discovered a stack of maybe 6 plates that I thought were clean (though I'm still not sure they were), some silverware, and one bowl. I also glanced at the buffet items, and thought, \""Oh, god, what have we gotten into?\"" The Wife came up to join me at the buffet, and while she was looking over the options, I started to serve myself some rice. I dug the rice scoop into the rice cooker only to discover that the rice was so overcooked that it was too hard to push the scoop into. So, I changed my mind about the rice and went to look more closely at the other food options.\n\nNone of the dishes were labeled, so it was a complete guessing game as to what food you might be serving yourself. The stuff that looked like chicken skewers were just sitting in a metal tray perched precariously on the edge of the buffet station, but they looked old and dry. One of the pasta dishes looked so slimy that it literally made me gag, and the other noodle dish looked old and crunchy, which is not how I ever want to eat noodles. The remainder of the dishes looked funky, old (like they had been sitting out for a while), and, again, we had absolutely no idea what any of them actually were.\n\nGiven how terrible EVERYTHING looked and how bad our initial service experience had been, we set our plates back on the table, left $1 to tip for the water, and walked out. I wish I hadn't wasted money on the Groupon to this place, but that sunk cost was minimal compared with our desire to just say, \""Mabu-bye\"" to this disgusting restaurant.

I walked in and i saw two stripper poles in the middle.\nThat alone gave me an idea of what my night would be like at JET.\n\nMe and my 4 girls got walked into the club on halloween night- we got to avoid the ridiculous line- and the entrance fee. That was definitely nice.\n\nThere was free sky vodka drinks for everyone (Not a big drinker, but my friends definitely appreciated it.)\n\nEveryone was in costume and enjoying themselves, but despite the spirit of halloween the club was just... whats the word I'm looking for... GHETTO.\n\nStripper poles, enough said.\n\nMusic wasn't flowing, a lot heavier on hip hop old and new (which isn't my thing to begin with.)\nAlso the crowd wasn't the best- I'm not elitist or anything, but what's the motivation of breaking out your best moves if there aren't any good looking people around?\n\nMe and my BFF couldn't take the Ghettoness of the place, and split- apparently that one chick Snookie from that one show was gonna be there, but since idk whotf she was, we left happily. That explained a lot about the type of crowd in the club last night- bunch of Jersey Shore wannabes.\n\nNo thanks Jet, not even for free.

Um, how did the other reviewers get food????\n\nJ and I went in on a Friday night with a WPXI half off deal.  We were ready to engulf ourselves in burgers and beers for at least $50 worth. \n\nInstead, I went to the bar and asked for a menu since there was no one else working in the place besides the one bartender on a Friday night.  She gave me a tiny happy hour menu.  I said, no, I'd like the dinner menu.  She said they weren't serving food besides happy hour.  I said, right now or ever?  She said ever.  They were getting new menus printed and weren't serving food.  \n\nShe did not [[tell]] me when they would be done or what else I should get.  I told her that I had a coupon.  She smiled and said [[nothing]]. \n\nSince WPXI won't get back to me about returning the half off deal - if only I could write a review on that - we will be returning for drinks and happy hour, but I will not be spending a cent more than the coupon. \n\nWho doesn't serve food when you advertise that you are the best burger in the city?

This is the place for the volume feed. As others have said, the portions are large if not downright scary. Moving beyond portion size, however, HH is not as big on flavor. \n\nI ordered the chicken and waffles-- the chicken (with the requisite sprig of rosemary) was crisp and moist, but rather bland. The belgian waffles had large pieces of bacon mixed into the batter and thus cooked into the waffle. Sadly, all I could taste was bacon. The 'maple reduction' drizzled around the waffle reminded me of a balsamic reduction and didn't really help. A side of syrup perked it up, but overall, hard to say it is worth ~$14. \n\nMy cousin had the corned beef hash- big pieces of corned beef but otherwise just as [[bland]] as my food. He say the (pizza-sized) flapjacks are better, so I may give it a try.  \n\nOverall, I think HH would be great if they can improve upon their flavors. Once over the novelty of big food, they [[need]] flavors to back them up.

Whenever I travel, I like to find an Ethiopian restaurant. It's usually in a part of town one wouldn't experience whilst staying in the business district. And it's usually an eatery, run by a husband and wife team, that's friendly to solo eaters, as I sometimes am.\nOn top of all that, Ethiopian food is HONEST--it's meat and veggies in straight-up yummy sauces, good for your body and mind!\n\nHere in Tempe, Lalibela is a good example of that down-home mom-and-pop cooking, Eth-style.\n\nIt's also a great spot to bring your friends and family. When you do, try the sampler platters; they're the best way to eat Ethiopian, emphasizing the communal nature of the feast (eaten with hands, not flatware).\n\nThe teas are delicious too.

Review is for dinner. I actually give it 2.5 stars but they deserve to be rounded down... Menu for dinner was tiny, disappointing. Decided to go with the Caribbean jambalaya and it was ok, but the flavors were a little too coconut-y. The pina colada on the rocks-esk drink I had was ok.\n\n Food made me sick afterward though, maybe it was the way too sweet drinks (only had two so don't blame it on the boos). It annoyed me that we paid over $100 for two people for OK food, and they were trying to convert everything over to club mode so we were rushed out and the end of our dinner was ruined with loud music. This was only at 9pm! \n\nI won't be back.

AWFUL!!!  Too bad you can't post without a star.  However, please consider going here if you:\n1.  Want it to take 40 minutes to get your food. \n2.  Don't care that when you look around the restaurant and see 10 other people, and management uses the excuse of \""they're busy\"" as to why your food took so long. \n3.  Don't care that they tell you there is a big VIP party behind the wall and that's why your food was late. \n4.  Love being told by incompetent management that the kitchen is slow because of a VIP party, behind the wall. (You should NEVER give another paying customer that excuse. It's not MY problem. I don't want to know of any problems when I've decided to come to your restaurant as a paying customer. Run a tight ship!  I don't want to hear it!)\n5.  Want to feel privileged that they are going to take a whole whopping $8 off our meal because it took sooooo long. \n6.  Want a free dessert offered by same incompetent manager, as a courtesy for taking sooooo long. This AFTER she was told TWICE we can't do dessert, because the kids have to go to bed. \n7.  Love having a wait staff that doesn't understand the importance of getting kids in and out. \n\nThe list could go on, but my husband and I were appalled. To note, our sushi was \""stringy\"" and the edamame was WAY over cooked. The Filet we ordered was for our 2 kids, which the waiter knew. No sense of urgency just TONS of idiotic excuses.

I wanted to like this place so much, but I just didn't have a good experience.  I went for lunch and ordered the sushi lunch platter. The rice tasted stale and dry. I asked for spicy on the sushi and they didnt add it. The waitress didn't understand a word I was saying. I'll try it again but am really disappointed

As if the airport wasn't ugly enough and the layout both annoying and tedious, McCarran had to assault our eardrums the entire time we were waiting at our gate with loud pop-twang country dog crap.  And they chose the worst of it too.  I had to reattach my ears when I got back to Portland, because they pretty much quit on me and walked away with a suitcase after being subjected to that torture.  The passenger clearly on a ton of meth (don't ask me how the TSA didn't notice) following us around with her tongue out didn't help either.\n\nAt least the security was nearly empty and quick as a beat.  That was about the only good thing.

This was my worst experience at this location... This whole experience started bad from the beginning when we arrived. First off the valet was closed, not a big problem we will self park which is not close, you have to walk the miracle mile to get to the hotel.\n We arrive to check in and that took us standing an hour & a half in line before we said screw this were not gonna miss our show. We stepped out of the line and decided to leave our luggage at the concierge. \nHours later, We finally checked into the hotel and were given a crappy room that was 2 queens not 1 king like we had asked. There was a seat that had suspicious white stain on the arm.  The restroom was horrible, we had dirty towels, a running toilet bowl, the water in the shower did not drain and the mirror in front of the restroom was broken. \nSo ofcourse I call the front desk and was told they could not do anything for the night everything was booked up. I told them to please have the manager call me so I can speak to them personally. I was told he would give me a call later. \nSo next day rolls around and was moved to a better room with a better view, which was very nice. Again I asked if I can talk to the manager and was told he was in a meeting. \nNow we go to check out and I asked one last time to talk to the manager and again he was in a meeting. So we left a negative comment card and ask for them to contact us so we can share our bad experience...\n So screw this place they lost my business. I've had very great times here before but I will not return no mo. I do not leave negative reviews but this one had to be done. I have pictures to share. \n\nOh and incase your wondering I have not been contacted by management staff to this date. VERY PROFESSIONAL PLANET HOLLYWOOD!!!

I really love this place, their food is sooo good.  But the service last night was not so good.  It took them 5 minutes to seat us, then another 5 minutes to wait on us by the time we ordered our food we missed happy hour.  We asked the waitress if we could still order off the happy hour menu and she said no.  It took her forever to bring our drinks finally out and then when our appetizer came out we asked about the cornbread, she said she would go get that.Then when we were finished we didn't get our bill in a timely manner either.  Ughhhh!!!!!\n\nNormally the service is really good but in this case it just wasen't.  Really disappointing last night.

I used to come here all the time with a buddy of mine to chow down on pizza and lasagna. Now, I don't go out of my way for it so much. \n\nThis place used to be so good, man. Like, super good. They had amazing pizza, though the prices were high. Still, we'd come here every other weekend. We were regulars, and it was our opinion at the time that the pizza here could not be beat. \n\nThat was then. Now, it seems that their pizza is less awesome. I don't know whether that's because the quality has indeed dropped, or maybe it's because I've gotten used to it and now I expect amazing things from this this place. Their lasagna is still good, though I'm certain that it has dropped in quality from where it used to be. \n\nBecause the pizza here is more expensive, it's easy for you to spend $15 on a meal here. Not that it's not worth it, but it just seems kinda pricey. The cool thing is that it's inside the NYNY, so you can eat a ton and then kinda walk around for a little and do the tourist thing. That way you don't feel super bad about eating so much!

This location is awful! HORRIBLE customer service. Not one employee smiled at us or greeted us. After we already ordered they told us that they were out of the pumpkin shmear, (which is the only reason we went) and we told them that we would like a refund and we will go to a different location. They rudely gave us a refund and while we were walking out told us that the pumpkin season was over and would not find it anywhere else. Why would they not inform us of this before we ordered and before our refund. Not to mention that advertisement of the pumpkin items are located all over their store. Because of their extremely poor customer service, we will never be returning to this location, and I suggest you save yourself from a bad mood and find a different location as well.

I'm officially addicted to the Mutabel (babaganush) at this place! The Armenians that run this joint have become my buds and know exactly what I like these days. Usually, I pull up to the front of the store located next to Trader Joe's and the owners are outside sipping espresso and smoking cigarettes like some scene from \""Eastern Promises\"" . For some reason, this relaxed mentality sets the mood for a great meal. I usually get hummus, but the Mutabel is the best in town by far! The service is sometimes a little awkward, but I forgive it because the staff is also very kind.

I got there ~5:30 on a Friday, so the place was almost empty, decor was nice, somewhat upscale w/o being too stuffy, and the staff courteous and attentive.\n\nI perused the menu for anything that would catch my eye, nothing stood out, seemed more or less your typical Italian menu. So I looked over the featured three-course meal - starter, entree and dessert for $30, where you pick one in each category, figured why not.  I ordered the lobster gnocchi, ribeye w/ red wine sauce and tiramisu. On top of that they had some nice touches of a higher-end restaurant, complimentary tomato brushetta and mango sorbet before the entree. The gnocchi was the best - the vodka sauce was light yet present, steak was undercooked in some parts and tiramisu was good  [[though]] espresso was faint if there at all.\n\nOverall, I thought this was a very good deal for the food, service and amenities.  If I had to pay more, it be more like a 3-star, but if you can take advantage of the three-course special, it's well [[worth]] it.

Eh...I really WANT to like this place, but it's become a little run down over the years.  I would jump at the opportunity to go to a \""true\"" gay sports bar, but this place just doesn't cut it.  It really needs to be about 1000 sq feet bigger to achieve the sports bar feel.  Plus they have these really old circa 1991 TV's to watch sports. (A costco run for some LCDs would go a long way here).   Beer is beer. When people play darts the place get's even smaller.  If only they would get the gay sports leaugues to commit to going there on a more regular basis...it's so hit or miss. \n    This place has SOOOO much potential, but it seems the owners are very happy with the status quo.

i've long been told of the goodness of soups from Union of Genius.  sadly though i'd never had a chance to visit this soup cafe as i don't work in town so couldn't go for a lunch break and don't live particually close by so not great for a weekend soup take away either.  but luckily, i was working at the Blood Donor Centre up the road and made it a point to get my lunch from Union of Genius.\n\nthe [[shop]] itself is small, with space for abotu 6 or so people to eat in around a very large wooden table.  [[however]] i was taking away, so it wasn't a problem.  there were five soup options and all sounded incredibly appealing but i was persuaded by the counter lady to have the roasted cauliflower with almond flakes.  i got a side of the olive bread and was on my way with soup and bread placed in a convenient carrier bag for me to bring back to the office.\n\nthe soup was lovely, seriously lovely and a massive portion!  it was [[warming]] and soooo incredibly tasted i wished i had opted for the large instead of the regular.  the roasted cauliflower added a really nice taste that was balanced well with the almonds and i think there was cumin seeds for a bit of earthiness.  my olive bread was similarly tasty and good for dunking in the soup.  it was with great sadness that i finished my last spoonful and used the last of my bread to mop up any soup left on the container.  it's unlikely i'll have a repeat visit to Union of Genius soon, but i would [[highly]] recommend this place for [[soupy]] [[goodness]]!

Went there because I'm new in town and  I'm a chicken wing, pizza and gyro [[connoisseur]].  They have all 3 there.   I ordered a gyro ($4.50 alone or $5.00 for the combo) and wings  ($7.95).  The total came to $15.95 so I stopped the guy and mentioned this. He said the 2 sides of blue cheese was 1 dollar a piece!  I was [[flabbergasted]].  I mentioned that NO WHERE have I ever been would they charge you 1 dollar a piece!  And they were small sides (1 heaping t-spoon).  I would pay 75 cents for a side at Genos's in Tempe for 3 times that amount of BC (needed for big orders).  Get this though, the guy will charge you 50 cents for substituting blue cheese for the regular side of ranch - because it cost more.  Seriously, 10 cc's of blue cheese is something that is too much to include with meal as every other plae that I have ever been to will?  Needless to say I cancelled my order.   I wonder, was it really worth it for him to lose that business, AND future business?  \n\nAs I was driving home, I thought about the 50 cents increase for the special.  I chose a can of coke instead of the fries.  But here's the math:  By his logic, the two small sides of blue cheese cost more than 4 cans of coke or 4 orders of fries (0.50 X 4  = the $2.00 for the sides of BC).  Crazy.\n\nI may go back for the gryo because it's on my way to school and back, and just around the corner, and it wasn't bad.  In a pinch will hit the spot, but it won't be regularly I can tell you that.  He could have had a customer a couple times a week and one that bought more than just a gryo being that I love wings and pizza as well.  Not just that, buy my roommate and I tend to eat out at the same place.

I never did, so I have no feelings towards that. I'm neither bothered by it. They do have few food options like Nathan's burger or sandwiches and hot dog. There is, by the way, a good chocolate store in the middle of the airport if you want to get some gifts or just get your chocolate fix here. It's not cheap. But good chocolate is never cheap anyway. \n\nEven it's very old, but everything is pretty well organized. All the signs are clear. And the line for getting a cab is long but super fast and super organized. No need to bump into anyone to fight for taxi, just get in line, the staff will tell you exactly what to do and where to go. Thumbs up!\n\nThere's also shuttles to most of the hotels. I believe it is $7 per person. It's very convenient.

[[DELICIOUS]]!!! We waited about 40 minutes for table of 3, but no big deal as you can have a beer, or two, and the people watching is great!  We ordered the cornbread as an appetizer.  Pure [[heaven]].  Buttery, sweet, smoky.  The brisket is so good, very tender and a great smoky taste.  The sauce is very flavorful, made me sweat!  If you like a sauce that is thick and sweet (like a sweet baby ray's, for example), this is not it.  Black Dog's is much better!  The sweet potato fries are nice and crispy, sweet/salty, and you get a nice portion of them.  The slaw is a vinegar slaw, not a creamy mayo slaw, so keep that in mind.

I hate bringing down a once 4 star review to one star, but it had to be done. If we ever go back, I'll see if it still stays the same.\n\nI went back a couple of weeks ago with my metal arts friends...and I have to say what a difference it was. Literally night and day.\n\nOur server was surly and pissy...the food was just appallingly bad...Flicka was nowhere to be found. Service was slow and it wasn't even busy. A whole...4 tables including ours?\n\nThe only remotely good thing about that night, though it's still NOT enough to make me give Flicka's 2 stars, is the checks were all split and correctly done.\n\nMaybe the employees decided to take a break since the owner wasn't there? Whatever it was, we won't be going back.

Mediocre at best. Most food was dried out and sitting under the heat lamps too long. Glad my experience was free- from a club promotion I earned in July. I wouldn't go again. Salad bar was the best part. Spinach and strawberry salad was the highlight. Desert ok. Most signs did not match food.  For example: The \""fried chicken\"" was roasted and dried out. Fried pot stickers were steamed. \n\nDrinks were so slow. I had two cokes. I was by myself. And it took 15+ minutes for my first one. I already had eaten most of my salad before it came. \n\nVery minimal offerings. Pasta bar (dry dry dry). What I assume was supposed to be Asian bar. Had lemon chicken, spring roll, dry noodle, etc. Prime rib was tough. \n\nJust not impressed. Small and dinky. Blah service. Dry food. I went on Friday August 22, 2014.

When I am in the area, I like to stop by the Las Vegas Premium Outlets. Preferably on a weekday when it is less crowded. 2b bebe is my [[favorite]] store here! I have to agree with what Chanel said, this store is not the same as bebe. If you are looking for the same merchandise found in bebe stores at discounted prices, you won't find any of that here. What you will find is cheaper quality products that are specifically made for 2b bebe. \n\nI love bebe, but I can't afford to shop there all the time. So 2b bebe is a great alternative for me! I find a lot of great merchandise here, and I like the fact that $50 will buy me 2 tops here in comparison to just 1 top at regular bebe stores. I think the quality of 2b bebe clothes is still better than Forever 21. In my experience, some of the things I purchased at Forever 21 got destroyed after just 2-3 washes. \n\nCustomer service is sometimes nonexistent. The employees who work on the weekends always seem tired and irritated. But that's understandable since this place is really busy on the weekends! Another time when I stopped in on a weekday, there were two employees standing in the front who were talking about what they did over the weekend and did not bother to greet any customers at all.

Food was cold when I got it. Both my husband and I found bone and hard chunks of fat in the hot link, my husband almost broke his tooth. We are true BBQ fans and tried every side and every meat... Mediocre at best. After eating at some of the best BBQ places in the south such as Franklin BBQ and salt lick etc. it ranks 2 stars below famous Dave's which I consider decent but still only mediocre BBQ. Would not return. Will try another restaurant in container park next time.

Possibly the first AND [[last]] time here.  I had read about this place and thought that it was a cool concept....do one thing and do one thing well (chicken fingers).  I decided to stop here on my way down to the game.  I went through the drive through and placed my order.  I ordered \""The Box Combo\"" which included 4 chicken strips, cole slaw, fries and a drink.  The price wasn't bad (under $7.00) and it sounded like it would be fantastic.  The drive through line took at least 10 minutes before I got my food.  Once I did get the goods, I pulled over, parked and dug in.  Here is how the food was............\n\nChicken Strips-  Meh!  The strips were a decent size but there were a couple of things working against them.     #1.  These things were WAY too hot.  I appreciate freshly made food but maybe you might want to let that shit sit for a minute and drain or something.  These were so hot you couldn't even eat them without burning your mouth.  Even after mouth breathing/cooling and sitting there for 10 minutes, my last strip was as scorching as the first!    #2.  I really didn't like the breading.  It is a really thin coating that is just a bit greasy.  The breading was kind of falling off in pieces and just seemed a bit \""off\"".     #3.  The taste of these things.  They were super duper plain jane.  It seemed like they could use a ton more seasoning and really didn't have any [[flavor]].  The dipping sauce helped, but still didn't make up for the fact that these strips [[looked]] good but had no taste.  Were they the nastiest things I have ever had?  No.  Can I make just as good or better chicken strips at home?  Yep!  This is their niche and [[unfortunately]] I didn't think they were anything special.  I much prefer Popeyes strips...at least they have flavor!\n\nFries-  Standard crinkle cut fries.  They were ok.  Crispy but needed some more salt.\n\nCole Slaw- Didn't try it.\n\nTexas Toast-  This was the best [[part]] of the meal.  Kind of reminded me of Sizzlers cheese toast but lesser quality (That is one thing Sizzler does better than anyone else....cheese toast.)  If I could have traded my fries and/or slaw for another slice, I would have done it.\n\nSoda- Coke Zero tasted a little \""off\"".  I have had a few instances so far in Phoenix where fountain soda has tasted weird.  Don't know what it is but Raising Cane's Coke Zero is in the same boat.\n\nSauce- Their sauce is a mayo based sauce...I took a tiny taste and didn't like it.  I did pay extra to get some honey mustard.  Their honey mustard sauce is actually pretty good.\n\nService in the drive through was friendly.  Slow but friendly.  I personally probably won't come back but I can see myself ending up here eventually...my wife loves chicken strips and I'm sure she will want to try this place out and I will be forced here with her.  Meh, right?  We shall see................

First time I went in there was to purchase a new R11. No service people around to help or they were to busy talking to one another. I left and went to another golf shop for purchase. \n\nI came in with my wife to look for a set of golf clubs for her. We walked around and had a few questions. Couldn't find any one around. I then approached 3 gentlemen at the training area, they did not acknowledge me for 3 minutes as I stood directly in front of the as they discussed their private lives. Finally I spoke up and asked for assistance, How sad that if im in front of you staring that I have to ask...\n\nAfter they answered my question they pointed over to where the box sets were and that was it. \n\nMy wife agreed that was terrible service!\n\nWe went over to the box sets and had more questions, but again had to chase a man who was quickly moving away as he saw us stare in his direction. \n\nAfter approaching him he gave a blank look and I just said never mind and left. \n\nI have finally decided after the many times that the prices are terrible and the service is terrible.

[[This]] is my first 1-star review, after roughly 30 reviews.\nAlthough reviews are subjective in nature, I think that Yelp reviews have an air of objectivity, which is why their reputation is what it is. I follow that credo. \nSince I've lived in Las Vegas, for one reason or another (mainly to play penny slots), I've been to practically every major casino in town, at all times of day: 6 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, and most recently 2 AM.  \nThis is my review of the atmosphere of the Fiesta Rancho casino. I've never stayed in one of their rooms (because I'm a local), I can't remember eating at any of their restaurants, I've never skated on their rink, and I've never gone into any of their nightclubs.\nI'm still [[scratching]] my head, regarding reviews written by other locals who live in the NW, yet have stayed in Fiesta rooms (and have checked-in multiple times). Can anyone clear that up for me?\nIn any event, I've not gambled at the Fiesta Rancho more than I have at any other casino.\nHowever, I've personally heard or have been in close proximity to 3 disturbing incidents at this casino, whereas I've not seen 1 at all the other casinos combined.\nWhile playing there, I've heard gun shots coming from the other side of the casino. Many years ago, my car was vandalized in their parking lot. At the time, I didn't pay it a second thought. Last night, a woman's [[purse]] was stolen, and the robbers escaped without a security guard in sight. In fact, the woman screamed for a security guard, and one didn't come over for 2 or 3 minutes.\nMaybe this is just a coincidence, but I really don't believe in coincidences.\nLike I said...Even though my own property was vandalized years ago, I continued to play there through last night, so this review is not biased from that event.\nBut, after last night, I'll [[never]] play there again. I don't want to worry about potential wrong-doings.\nI'll gamble with money, but I don't wish to gamble with anything more precious.\nSorry.

Don't waste your time or money on this place!  With so many good restaurants and bars to choose from in Vegas, do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here.  Steak burrito arrived pretty much cold; small $8 beer started semi-cold but was warm in a few minutes since it was served in a cheap plastic cup.  $55 for a cold burrito, warm beer, salad and an iced tea - give me a break!

Pretty much agree with the other [[reviews]] but have to say that the super long wait for a table and ridiculously loud atmosphere (although it is really kinda cool and trendy) is [[worth]] it for the turkey [[pastrami]] sandwich. Forget [[everything]] else on the menu and [[get]] this sandwich. Just do it. It's the [[best]] sandwich I've ever had and I've had some [[amazing]] sandwiches and I'm super [[picky]], too!! The cole slaw is [[amazing]]. The turkey is smokey and lean. The [[pretzel]] bun is to die for. SO good. We also always get the cheese plate. We're from Wisconsin. We know good cheese. This place has a great cheese plate. I also tried the [[grilled]] cheese sliders but seriously, nothing else is as good as the turkey. Sat next to a guy who almost had an orgasm over the monkey bread dessert but I didn't try it (should have!) Overall, it's [[worth]] the wait and noise but they really, really need to get on Open Table and start taking reservations. Would help a lot. Also need some waiting areas and to cut back on the volume of the music or add some acoustic elements so you're not deaf when you leave. Wouldn't mind some better cocktails, too. I've had two and neither of them were very good. I'll go for wine next time. Will still go back for the food but hope to see some improvement on the flow of the restaurant, overall. I'll continue to try to go on weeknights and late at night so I can get in without standing outside for an hour.

Let's face it- it's a Wendy's.  You know what the menu is, and what to expect.  Really, all you can review is the service, which is pretty bad here.  \n\nMy order has been consistently wrong here.  When I get a salad, or a sandwich with lettuce, the lettuce is not fresh.  The service is rather poor.  Specifically, it takes noticeably longer to get food at this location, and often, the staff aren't making sure they are making food to order.  \n\nAdditionally (and this may seem like a strange note) the line rails leading up to order in the restaurant are not set like every other Wendy's.  It doesn't use the space well, and it's not clear where to stand. \n\nMy office very close to this location, yet I go out of my way to the Wendy's at 2801 Boyer Street instead.  They have much better service.

DO NOT stay at this hotel if you expect quality service, quality surroundings and a quality stay.  I booked this hotel for a quick getaway with my Granddaughter.  The first thing she noticed when we checked into our worn room was the \""intimacy kit\"".  I have stayed in tons of hotels thruout the years, but this was a first.  Then we went down to the Pink Taco for dinner.  We arrived around 6:30 PM, BEFORE the [[partying]] really gets started.  There were lots of available tables at that time, but the hostess thought it would be a good idea to seat a group of middle aged, DRUNK men right next to us.  [[Great]].  [[They]] scared my Granddaughter and we left. By the way, the prices at the Pink Taco are outrageous and the food is awful.   Save some money and step up your game - go to Taco Bell!

Worst club in Vegas. Fuck a club where you can't ask for party favors (meaning fireworks for a bachelor party) bc they have a zero tolerance for anything fun. And you'll get walked out like a criminal with the schmuck security manager and a goon bouncer. Ruined a Vegas weekend altogether and will never be back. Not recommended to ANYONE. F This dump.  Not to mention they took $700 of prepaid dough from my boys and didn't give two fucks about any type of refund. Avoid at all costs.

Keep your eyes open, I almost drove right by this place. Might have been because it's a lot more house-looking than restaurant-looking. [[Not]] complaining, just saying.

Did I just say nomenclature? Did I use it correctly?\n \nAnyhoo - was part of a large group like I said, so I got to sample/steal bits and pieces of several different menu options.. cheese, cranberries, and candied almonds from the antipasto plate, shrimp and veggies from the skewer plate, more candied almonds from the antipasto plate, the empanadas - ooh, the empanadas - they were the best part. I'm not sure which I enjoyed more, the eggplant/zuchini/blue cheese & pine nuts or the Mushroom/onions/almonds & parmesan cheese.. Probably the eggplant, which is weird, because I don't normally care for eggplant. Oh, but the mushrooms were so [[good]]. Hmm.. think I'll have to go back and have them again to be sure. Lastly, we ordered the seared ahi mini-sandwiches with wasabi sauce, which I loved - though the Yelper I shared them with didn't so much. But she's crazy, you shouldn't listen to her.

I'm not sure what the hype is about. Having experienced the Gourmet Burger craze in both LA and Dallas maybe my expectations are just too high. Their \""Gold Standard\"" burger has been touted as the best in Vegas... this has to be a joke. The mix of flavors were not balanced well. The goat cheese did not compliment the beef in any way. The ingredients were of good quality but not what I would expect for the price point. \n\nIn general I would say everything on the menu was quite overpriced (even by Vegas standards). This is where Holsteins really fell short for me. I've had $10 burgers that blow this one away. Not to be super whiny but on top of the food not meeting my expectations  the service was a bit slow and my burger was slightly overcooked. Nothing egregious, but I would feel remiss to not point it out here. We tried the Lobster Mac & Cheese appetizer to start and I can't help but compare it to the Lobster Mac at The Capital Grille which is of better quality, a larger portion and actually cheaper than Holsteins. Even the steak fries were uninspired and blah. \n\nOverall I was disappointed at every turn by this place. The food was acceptable and I won't say it was a bad meal but it does not live up to the bar they have set for themselves. I would not go back. Save your money and go to one of the many other great restaurants in Las Vegas.

It's hard to find an authentic place to eat these days. The ambiance, decor, and food were just that. Everything we had was delicious (and unique, to us at least) from the Larb, to the spicy pickled cucumbers. The Pad Thai was wonderful as well. Our favorite by far, however, and large enough to feed 2-4 people alone was the Seafood Soup. The flavors were powerful and delectable. We were full for like two days, haha. Great service too. We went at 5pm on a Sat. night and we basically had the place to ourselves. It was very busy by 7pm. When we're back in that area, there is no [[doubt]] we will go there again!  Not [[expensive]], very [[reasonably]] priced, [[ESPECIALLY]] [[considering]] how much food we had (and had left over). Reservations recommended.

I took my wife here for lunch today. We both tried the clam chowder, which although pretty tasty,  was thin and the carrots and potato were under cooked. I tried the Alaskan Whitefish and the salt and pepper catfish fillet. Both were tasty, but there was enough oil to puddle on the bottom of my plate. I tried the onion rings and found them to be large and [[without]] much [[flavor]].  The problem with the coleslaw is that they chop the cabbage too finely and it turns out more like a mush than a salad. The worst part was, even though the parking lot was almost empty, it took longer waiting in line to pay the bill than it did to eat the meal Would I go back? Yeah...the next time I have an overwhelming desire to listen to my arteries harden  while I ate!

I am very pleased with the homemade Popsicle shop called, 'Paletas Betty'. Around last week, a couple friends and I were walking down Mill and spotted this cute little shop.

I would not go back to yogini again.  They are NOT honest people & quite confrontational.  They pulled a bate and switch on their pricing..  They told me I could pay there, on site, for a living social deal $19 unlimited yoga.  They took my $20.  I took the class, and now they  just called to tell me that I have to buy it through living social.  So, I have to pay another $19 to get this deal.  I just paid $20.   When trying to explain that the receptionist took my $20 with the verbal agreement of unlimited yoga for a month,  she hung up on me.\n    If I would have gotton the deal, I would have gone four times to feel I got my money's worth.  If I would have gotten the class for free I would not go back again.  So, what it comes down to is... this studio leaves much to be desired and to top it off they are not nice.  WARNINING. Do Not Go To Yoginis.

ate there recently for dinner, it was wonderful. i ordered the goat curry and was excited to try goat for the first time right after i found out it is the most consumed meat on earth outside of the US BUT the table of 12 Indian gentleman behind us had ordered it all....which led me to believe these guys know what they are doing. instead i tried the lamb and it was perfect. i really liked the candor of our waiter \""andrew\"", which was not his name but he called himself that with a grinning smirk; i told him i had ordered kingfisher lagers before and would love to try another beer since they had a few indian beers, he told me to stay with the kingfisher. also, once he told me the goat curry wasn't available i ordered tandoori lamb, he assured me it was good but encouraged me to try the curried lamb since i originally ordered goat curry. my ladyfriend ordered a veggie dish and loved it, we got some bread as well, she ordered some REASONABLY (which is becoming more rare these days) priced wine. all in all the food was very [[good]] and the service was near [[perfect]], i like when a waiter can read what you are looking for, makes reco's on that judgment and nails them. i will be going back to maharani [[frequently]] for both the food and smiling faces that provide you perfect service.

If I were just reviewing for the food, my review would be much higher..

Did I order something special or difficult? \nA. No. I ordered soup. \n\nBy the time it came for paying and getting our check, we thought our server must have gone on break or something.

[[This]] [[used]] to be my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix.  About a year ago my husband and I both became violently ill a few hours after eating there, and after reviewing what we ate in common determined it had to be the salsa.  So we stayed away until Sat. night when we decided to give it a try again.  The place has always been scary by its appearance but we were amazed how much it had run down in just a year.  Everything was dirty, from the floors on up, including the inch of grime covering all the crap hanging on the walls, which keeps them from really cleaning or putting a badly needed fresh coat of paint on the place.  There are holes in the booths with stuffing spilling out and there was a big smear of dried [[salsa]] on the [[mirror]] [[hanging]] right next to my head.  All very [[unappealing]]!  Add to that stale, tough tortilla chips, a very bland green chili burro and watered-down Margarita and I'm writing off an old favorite.   Unless you really like the dangerous feeling you get when you walk into a border town dive, stay away!

The view can't be [[beat]]!  The food is delicious, but sadly, like other reviewers, the service was lacking.  For $100+ per person, I should NEVER have to ask for refills on water, wine or cocktails.  I would imagine that at any resort, the first questions a server would ask would be about where we are from and what brought us to that property.  This was not the case.  Thank goodness the neglect of our server was over shadowed by the food.  \n\nThe food runners on the other hand were quick, knowledgeable and running their cute butts off!\n\nOscars, you need to train your servers to pay attention to the fact that they work in a 3 star steakhouse in Las Vegas.  They give service that is less attentive then the Outback down the street from me.  I'd love to return for those crab cakes, prime rib and Mac and cheese, but I'll take my business back down Freemont to Vic & Anthony's.

I've been here 3 times for a group happy hour. \n\nThe first time, it was excellent.  Had a great waiter who stayed on top of things and even came over to remind us about happy hour ending and to see if we wanted any more drink orders so he could get them in before the cut off.\n\nThe second time, it was a bit worse.  We had a large group, and took up the entire patio.  However, there was only 1 waitress for about 40 of us.  She forgot orders, brought out wrong things, and had no idea who ordered which thing.  She overcharged me too many drinks that had already been paid for.\n\nBut since they have decent food, and GREAT prices during happy hour, we decided to come a third time.\nApparently the manager didn't appreciate our business because he immediately asked when we would be leaving.  He said that we take up the entire patio and no one else can sit out there because we take all the seats.  Mind you, every single person there is a customer.  Every single one of us ordered multiple drinks and plenty of food.  It's not like anyone was just sitting taking a seat, but not paying for anything.\nThis manager was so rude, that my co-workers debated leaving right then.  We will definitely not come back again.  We also do a fund raiser with them and our school once or twice a year.  We are planning on canceling that.\n\nThey have lost our business now, which is unfortunate.\n\n\nIf you have a large group, go elsewhere.  If you are looking for cheap drinks, and there's only a few of you, this is an okay place.  The pretzels are cheap and okay, nothing special.\n\nMy major compliment is that they have Wyder's Pear Cider, which is my favorite!

Some of the worst, over priced, bland food I have ever had in my life!  \""Garlic\"" bread they brought to the table had no flavor and was cold. Wouldn't give it to my dogs. The salad was composed of the cheapest lettuce known to man...with 2 or 3 good pieces of lettuce thrown in there. Insulting basically. Then the pasta comes. Meat sauce was watery with very few pieces of meat. Beers were over priced. Tables were so close together that my boyfriends chair got hit every time a waiter walked by. Once the 60 year + crowd stops coming, this place will hopefully go out of business. Ugh!!!! I want my 50 bucks back

Totally underwhelmed and it took 45 minutes to bring out a mediocre po-boy sandwhich and a jumbalaya.  We just sat there twiddling our thumbs eating some bread (which was probably the best part of the meal to be honest). \n\nWe weren't even given any explanation until we were paying our bill.  Apparantly Emeril was in town and was going to drop by the restaurant and everyone was on \""pins and needles\""...I'd think they'd want to step up their game instead of fall on their ass? \n\nWaiter seemed to be pretty knowledable, they must have trained him with a script because the way he described the food (great) did not match up to the final result (not so great). \n\nStarted off with Calamari, which was about average. The dipping sauces were non-descript but the banana peppers were a nice touch on the top.  \n\nThe carnitas po-boy was very mediocre. The fried pickles were not worth mentioning and the taste was something I could replicated if I got some french bred, put deli cole-slaw in there with some carnitas from baja fresh.  Keep in mind, perhaps I would only use 1/3 of the amount of carnitas from a baja burrito as there was barely any on the sandwich.

The croutons were so soaked they were black.

I called around to locate and get price quotes for specific tires with an \""out the door\"" price including mounting and balancing. Purcell quoted less expensive than the rest. I agreed, made an appointment and they ordered the tires. When I got there they tried to sell me the scam tire insurance (It only adds replacement coverage for the 2% of punctures which are not repairable, and only at their chain) and I declined. The price which I was quoted was not the price I paid. They had two individual itemized charges for both balancing and for tire disposal and added a materials fee. It was about $70.00 over the \""out the door\"" price, which became more expensive the last time I purchased identical tires elsewhere and competitor's phone quotes. \n\nThey opened my hood and poked around while I was not present without my permission, then tried to convince me to have them do additional work which they described as dire. There is NO reason to open my hood during a tire transaction. It took almost two hours to change four tires despite an appointment and not being busy. This week I got a coupon in the mail, since they also added me to their mailing list without asking. I won't be using it. \n\nI'll give them some credit, though- they didn't take a chunk out of my rim like discount tire did with their rushed work. There is obviously a reason why business is slow for this shop when the scammable ASU students are away and why they have no reputation on Yelp. I gave two stars because the product itself is what I asked for and they were installed properly. They did do something right.

I apologize if I've got the wrong location, but maybe that's part of the problem. All I know is that this is the place where the deliveries for S Scottsdale residential originate And that the supervisor for the deliverymen is \""Art.\"" I was expecting a next-day delivery to an easily-located spot and waited with my door open all day to receive the pkg. When it hadn't arrived by 7:00 p.m., I called customer service and was told they had until 8:00 pm to complete the delivery. I tracked the pkg online, and as I sat there, still waiting, online update said they were unable to deliver--no one home or business closed, and had returned the pkg to the station.\n\nThis was a blatant lie, as the driver clearly made no attempt to deliver the pkg. I later learned others in this area had the same experience that day. Next day, after many calls to customer service, my package was delivered by a very nice delivery woman--she had encountered angry customers all along her route that morning because of the poor service by a different deliveryman the previous day. The problem is that no one locally will take responsibility for the behavior of the drivers. Customer service try to help but they are located in another state. I asked to be connected to the location where the local driver originates, but when I asked for \""Art,\"" the supervisor,  he of course, was not available, and a message for him to call me was never returned.\n\nThis is the worst delivery service I've encountered in quite some time. The previous Sunday afternoon, the US Postal Service delivered another package, and the day before, UPS was promptly at my door to pick up a package. Years ago, FedEx was the premier delivery service, but they have clearly lowered their standards for driver conduct to the point that they have no standard at all--and clearly drivers know there will be no consequences when they \""blow off\"" a customer or several customers, because even their supervisor doesn't return customer calls. Why should drivers care?

This restaurant is one of the filthiest I've ever visited in the entire world (and I travel frequently to third-world countries on business). During my lunchtime visit the dining room tables were strewn with uncollected plates and uneaten food, the steam table buffet had food scraps hanging all over it, and the carpeting was full of stains from ground-in food particles. If that wasn't bad enough the buffet food was terrible, too.  It all appeared to come from frozen, restaurant supply entrees--very oily stuff with poor smell, taste and appearance.  During the 30 minutes I was there, someone at another table complained about an unidentified object in her noodles, while another customer complained that the buffet was essentially empty.  This place isn't even worth the 5.99 +tax for lunch, even if it does include beverage.  YUCKERS to the core!

Never. Ever. Again. I had to stay at this hotel to be close to the convention center this past May. It's one of the biggest conventions they have, so you would think that a little prep work might have gone into their hospitality. No. The room that I stayed in was dirty, but even stains I can get past (blood stain on me sheet that, after 3 days was never changed). The thing I can't get over is the service. I had arranged for breakfast to be brought to my room every morning. I called the night before and was told it would be to my room first thing. I stressed that I had to be out of my room by 8 in the morning at the absolute latest. They said, not a problem. 2 out of the 3 days, it never came. Just never came at all. After I called and called I was met with rude ladies who seemed more aggravated that I was bothering them than anything else. Also, I called them to have my tv fixed which wasn't working. I had to call 4 times to get even a timeline of when I might see someone. After a few hours, I decided to give it a go myself. I would seriously dismay any person from ever booking here. Being in close vicinity to the convention center is not worth the lack of service and filth that this hotel has to offer. \n\nI will say that there is one saving grace. The bell hops who brought up the food (the one time it came for breakfast) and the other time when we ordered dinner (extremely low in quality...I don't recommend it) were extremely nice. They were older and seemed genuinely concerned with our well being. \n\nSuper side note, the people who end up at that pool seem like Vegas's throw aways...just saying.

Nothing is new here about my bad experience. But hopefully I can shed some light into their evil world. And then the travelers can choose wisely.\n\nUS Worst has retained its title for me in 2011.\n\nTypical story. Mechanical failure. Flight was delayed in Palm Springs. I missed the connection in Phoenix. I was rescheduled for later flight. A delay of 4 hours.\n\nI always avoid US Worst but sometimes it's just impossible. It helps when US Worst is part of Star Alliance (Wrong... more later). I was a United Premier member. I thought I still can get my benefit on US Worst. That's a wrong assumption.\n\nI have experienced nightmares on more than 50% of US Worst flights. More so lately... 100% in past 2 years (2 flights). Luckily I've shifted all possible flights to other not so worst airlines.\n\nTo make a long tedious nightmare educational:\n1) US Worst does not recognize the full status of United Premier. Not like United and Continental.\n\n2) It's business as usual for US Worst. The costumer service rep expressed indifference. It reminds me of rental clerks in Las Vegas and FlorIda (\""you don't like it? Too bad! Move aside, there's a long line waiting for our premiere service\"") There is no apology. The mechanic failure and that delayed flight did not qualify for any compensation.\n\nSo travelers, kowtow to the Almighty US Worst whom provides world class service to everyone. I wonder what service you will get in economy class.

Dear Roka Akor,\n\nI want this to be a love letter but it's not. We had such a short relationship but I feel we have to break up.\n\nI spent $200 at dinner for 3 ozs of fish, one appetizer, and two drinks. And the worst part was it didn't even taste very good. \n\nOur waiter was obsequiously friendly and recommended that if I was a sushi connoisseur I should have the best sushi. Fine, OK, I hear Roka that you are a top 10 sushi restaurant in USA. I have had sushi at some of the others, let's see how you stack up. I am willing to pay for quality.\n\nYour sashimi was of questionably quality, marinated to perdition in order to hide the fishy taste that only emerges when fish begins to rot. The fatty tuna was regular tuna. The portions were tiny! Seriously about 3 ozs of fish for two orders of the chef's choice best sashimi. Some of the flavors of the marinates were quite good, I give you that. But just like spandex does not make the obese look sexy, so vinegar and soy does not make low quality fish sexy. I have eaten fish off the boat at the fish market in Tokyo, not only were you not nearly as good, you weren't even nearly as good as some conveyor belt dining sushi I've had. Don't tell me this is the best you can do!\n\nI must have looked like I had money, or looked too blonde (I'm a brunette btw), because the happy hour menu was never mentioned. Happy hour prices were in effect but the one appetizer I ordered which should have been covered by the happy hour menu was charged at full price. \n\nI couldn't run away from you fast enough. Return? No. Why would I want to return to an abusive relationship?

I went here for lunch, and while not that good, it was alright. I had a catfish po-boy with sweet potato fries and a side of andouille sausage. The sausage and fries were frozen products, but the po-boy was quite good. 2-3 star meal, max.\nLater I came for dinner with a group and was let down. We got a large bowl of seafood gumbo (bland and OLD rubbery seafood), multiple side dishes (all of which were either store bought products or poorly made), and their 5 pound crawfish boil special. They were advertised as Live Crawfish outside. I highly doubt that. They didn't even taste fresh, and were the smallest and least meaty crawfish I've ever had. For a 5 pound pot of crawfish, there was only 1 sausage link cut up in it, and even worse only 1 corn cob cut up. Easily the worst cajun boil I've seen. They tried everything they possibly could to cut corners and cut costs across everything they served. 1 star meal.\nAvoid this place.

My husband is an old school pinball/arcade junkie and says it reflects a [[misspent]] youth.  This place is a [[wonderful]] [[interactive]] museum.  There are some very old pinball machines (1937, maybe older and you can play it) or newer ones that have just about every character you can think of.  There are also a handful of other machines including arcade stuff.  My husband plays some track and field thing he [[loves]].  The machines cost whatever they did at time of distribution, so some are a quarter, some 50 or 75.  It is great to see someone using their own hobby and passion and sharing it with others and doing so so successfully.  This place is no [[frills]], just rows and rows of machines and other visitors.  It has moved to a new bigger warehouse type location, which is a few miles east of strip on tropicana.

Citizen Public House is an upscale, modern American restaurant where you can find plenty of unique dishes and a signature salad with its own Facebook site.\n\nMy Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)\n\nAtmosphere - We checked out Citizen Public House on a week night, but it was still busy.  Lights will be dim, noise will be loud, but everything around you is modern.  If you're looking for a quiet place, Citizen Public House is not it.  But if you're ok with the high energy and noise you'll love it.\n\nService - Our server was better than great.  He was very [[accommodating]].   We made reservations over the phone for a large party, and he secured a semi-private room for us and let us put in several appetizer orders ahead of time.  Throughout the meal the entire team went above & beyond, making sure we were ok, talking about our love of food, and making sure our experience would be perfect.  1 Star.\n\nFood - The appetizers rule at Citizen Public House.  I think it's ridiculous that a SALAD has its own Facebook page.  Then I ate it.  It was ridiculously good.  The presentation itself is great, and once the servers mix it together, it becomes a fresh, modern, texture packed bite.  I will admit I doubted it but now I'm a believer. Bacon fat popcorn.  Yes.  It was even great the next day.  Pork Belly Pastrami - tender, well-seasoned, and could have been my main meal.  Which is funny because looking back, I enjoyed all the appetizers a lot more than the main courses.  The scallops were good and my short rib was not as tender as I would have liked, but after our appetizer fest it really didn't matter.  Bottom line is the pre-meal is where I'll put my money in the future.  1  1/2 Star.\n\nWill I Return? - For the apps!  Not sure the main courses are worth it for a return visit, but I would come back and order the same delicious starters as I did that night.  Now, Citizen Public House is not cheap, so that's all I would be able to afford.   1/2 Star.\n\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \n\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score.

Voted best in 2013.\n\nSome of his tricks seemed a bit redundant, but a few were awesome to watch.  I would like to see what he could do given a better venue and bigger budget.  The best part is his personality and friendliness and he sticks around after the show to talk to each and every person and takes pictures with him.  I wish him the best of luck on his career.

We stayed at THE Hotel at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas.  Since we were there we decided to try Aureole for dinner.  \n\nThe GOOD- \n1) The location and scenery were great! The 4-story wine tower is incredible to look at and fun to watch the ladies in their \""Mission Impossible\"" suits go to get the wine bottles.\n2) The food- read below for more information\n3) The service was as [[good]] as I've had at a fine dining establishment.  From the lady serving bread, to the man who took our order, to the Sommelier who recommended a nice bottle of wine.\n\nThe OK-\n1) The restaurant is a pricy place to eat.  It was over $300 for the two of us.  But I guess you have to expect that in Vegas!\n2) The wine list is quite [[cumbersome]] so if you are like us and aren't the smartest when it comes to wine, it's hard to pick one.  We're both fans of the red wines, especially Zinfandel's from the Dry Creek area (Healdsburg, Sonoma County) and they didn't have many wines from that region to choose from on their list.\n\nThe FOOD-\nWe both ordered from the Chef Vincent's Market Menu. The Salt and Pepper [[Calamari]] has got to be some of the [[BEST]] I've ever had.  It didn't need any dipping sauce and the calamari pieces were [[perfectly]] lightly breaded so that you could taste the calamari, not just the breading.  I had the seared Rainbow Trout and it was good.  I wasn't a fan of the skin being served along with the fish, but I ate around it and the fish was really tasty.  The white asparagus was overcooked for my taste, but the whole dish itself was prepared well and seasoned good.  My boyfriend had the American Wagyu Beef Skirt Steak and he LOVED it!  There was nothing left but an empty plate when he was finished.  For dessert I ordered the Salted Caramel Bomb cake and my boyfriend had the Orange Grand Marnier Creme Caramel.  Both desserts were great, but my [[favorite]] was the blood orange sorbet served with the Creme Caramel.  It was to [[die]] for!!!\n\nWe also ordered a bottle of 2007 Joseph Phelps Cabernet Savignon that was really good! \n\nOverall, our experience at Aureole was awesome.  Hopefully we will be back to enjoy another great dining experience!

Worst pedicure ever! Went in there for the first time yesterday afternoon. They were busy but still had plenty of chairs open for pedicures. My friend and I got seated right away and everything seemed great. Then the nail tech handed me the card to pick out which pedicure I wanted. The \""regular\"" is $19 and includes \""nail trimming, brief massage, basic nail color.\"" The only other option was a $40 one with callus remover, scrub and paraffin wax. Kind of ridiculous that they only have two options with such big price differences. All other nail places I've been to at least include hot stone and a decent massage in their basic pedicure. I chose the regular with no extras. The nail tech seemed annoyed by that and totally rushed through everything. The lotion \""massage\"" was pretty much just her slapping some lotion on my legs. We were out of there in about a half hour, which is the shortest time I've ever been in a nail salon for a pedicure. The nail tech did not thank us for our business and did not ask to see us again.. so I will never go back again!

Went here on a Saturday afternoon and there were 3 of us. I don't really care for Buffet food at Indian restaurants, so we had take out. The place looks good enough from the inside, but i was extremely [[disappointed]] by the food. All of the naan were burnt on the underside. The kofta curry had coconut in it, which is kind of odd. Not to mention all of us had stomach problems the very next day. Now if it was just one person, then I can understand. But as all three of us felt sick, I have no doubt in my mind that it was their food. Will [[never]] try this place again.

Service was prompt and friendly. [[Unfortunately]] the food was barely mediocre. I had the clams in white wine and garlic sauce and although the sauce was palatable, the clams were chewy and [[tasteless]]. We also had the spaghetti with meat sauce, which was very typical and hamburger-y. Definitely feel like we could have had much better Italian food in the area for the same price. Shame.

So brunch buffets are as synonymous with Las Vegas as Lebron is to basketball, and there is a whole lot of winning going on at the Sterling Brunch in the Bally's Hotel and Casino. Tucked in the back of the ground floor of Bally's in the BLT Steak restaurant rests one of the newest, and I will say it, [[finest]] brunch buffets in Las Vegas.\n\nNow it isn't called the \""Sterling\"" Brunch for no reason, it costs, it costs [[big]] time.\n\nMost of us are not willing to pay $90 per person for brunch, but because of the high quality of seafood, meats and champagne that they serve, I must admit, the price tag is justified. I [[usually]] avoid buffets in [[general]] as quantity is NOT what gets me hard, it's the quality, and the Sterling Brunch has both.\n\nWhen you are [[seated]] you are immediately served two Gruyere popovers. For those of you who are new to popovers, as I was, they are an American version of English Yorkshire pudding. They are baked custard in muffin tins, but the inside is not dense, it is very light and [[moist]]. It was pretty insane. It was as if the crispy shell was basted for hours with liquefied cheese as the flavor of the Gruyere was wonderfully powerful. Slather some sea-salted butter on the inside and you are ready to party.\n\nAs a start for brunch, or any meal for that matter, it doesn't get better than this.\n\nNext up was the buffet. On my first round I focused solely on seafood, the options were far and wide in this category alone. Baked lobster tail, King crab legs, crab claws, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and crab cakes.\n\nUm, yes.\n\nOut of all of them I recommend the baked lobster tail and the King crab legs the most, the quality of them were excellent and the flavors were good and rich. Skip the crab cake. It will take up too [[much]] valuable real estate; not to mention it kinda blows.\n\nNow the offering of caviar is one of the major reasons this brunch [[stands]] out. That, and the unlimited Perrier-Jouet Grand Brut champagne (a $50/bottle value). Though the caviar is American Amia (bowfin roe from Louisiana), which, though quiet common and inexpensive, is still a buffet rarity and presented with blinis, cr\u00e8me fraiche, capers and finely diced red onion so you feel, well, spoiled. Regardless.\n\nEgg me, baby.\n\nThe caviar is just one of the many items offered on their menu outside of the buffet options. We ordered the Caesar salad, tuna tartar, the lobster eggs Benedict and the lobster bisque; the bisque was a bit more like a bouillabaisse but still yummy.\n\nNow, they also offer filet mignon, truffled mashed potatoes and creamed spinach as well as lamb chops so one can get their steakhouse on.\n\nI sampled them as a dessert substitute because, well, I've always been more of a salt guy than a sugar dude. But alas my stomach could hold no more, but if one were so inclined, and has a larger stomach muscle than my own, feel free to polish off those dishes as well because they are good times.\n\nAdeye took the trip down Dessert Ave.  It's one of the prettiest avenues I have seen and she seemed very pleased.\n\nSterling Brunch. You have raised the brunch bar so high we could barely get our legs and bellies over it. Congratulations for redefining the Vegas buffet for those of us who care about quality.

I love Rosati's, and I've ordered from this store dozens of times. The staff is friendly and the pizza is awesome. We usually get either the thin crust or the Chicago style. \nSo why only 2 stars? A couple of weeks ago we ordered a thin with cheese and a Chicago with pepperoni. I go pick it up, take it home only to find that the Chicago pizza's crust was severly undercooked. It was very obvious just by looking at it. Of course we tried to eat some but it was really bad. \nI call the store back and tell them, they offer to make another one. Come pick it up in 20 minutes. I drive back to the store and the manager (I think) is sitting out front and asks me why I'm back so soon. I tell her the pizza was not cooked. She makes some comment \""oh really?!?\"" or something but never gets up from her chair. The kid working the counter brings out my new pizza and we open both the new and the old boxes to compare. It was very obvious that the original pizza was undercooked when comparing the 2. \n\nSo my take on it is that they KNEW the pizza was bad and figured they could serve it to me and I wouldn't notice or complain OR the person cooking the pizzas is blind and/or doesn't care whether the pizza is good or not. Either way, this is uncacceptable! \n\nAnd to make matters worse. All I got was a half-hearted lame apology from the counter kid. Not that I was expecting them to give me the pizza for free but come on! No coupon, no offer of any compensation whatsoever. Lame! Especially when spending almost $30 for 2 pizzas. \n\nBut whatever, I might go back because I really do like the pizza but I think they need to step up thier game in the service department.

Standard fried, bar food. Needed to find somewhere kid friendly, in a hurry when visiting Old Montreal. The pub is very spacious with good views of the river and Rue St.Paul. It's a nice renovation of an old warehouse type building and has kept some of its old world charm. The place was lively and busy but not raucous. We didn't have high expectations of the food and as expected it was pretty [[average]]. The Nachos were good, as were the very small chicken wings. The Burger was OK, nothing special, but my wife hardly touched her pasta duo - a combo of their tomato and alfredo pastas. The tomato one tasted like it was straight out of a jar and the alfredo just [[lacked]] flavor. I wouldn't come back here, but for what we needed it suited just fine (don't get the pasta).

We had vouchers for everyday including our fifth morning which was Monday but there was no breakfast to be found-whatever.\n\n-Charging for internet/parking\n\nI would maybe stay here again if we were attending the Swim meet but will definitely investigate other options.

[[Love]] the atmosphere in a renovated older building with stained glass windows and mosaic tile floors and wooden furniture, which feels like a traditional cocktail bar. It definitely has a hipster feel to it, and most of the servers and bartenders give off that vibe.  I've enjoyed all the cocktails they've had here, which include some more traditional as well as some more modern spins on things. They do have a few snack options but it is quite limited.  What I've tried has been good but they are just super small snack size portions.  I hope they end up expanding their menu a bit.  Originally I heard people rave about the deviled eggs but they don't seem to offer them anymore and I never got to try them.  They seem to be working on an expansion in the back room so maybe they have some bigger plans.  The service has always been friendly and efficient and this place has a nice low [[key]] vibe to it.

I want to absolutely love South Point, since it's adjacent to the Grandview so I frequent it a lot during my week stay.  I've also stayed in their rooms for additional nights outside of my timeshare.  So I stayed there again this past Saturday night, the second time since shortly after they first opened.  \n\n1.  It's clean.\n\n2.  The room is large, 2 queen beds, plenty of space.\n\n3.  It's relatively cheap - I paid $86ish (Saturday night) on an online offer.\n\n4.  The non-smoking room I had on the 8th floor reminded my of Jean Nate.  I'm not even sure they make that anymore, but I remember buying my mother some of it for Mother's Day about 30 years ago.  It even came in a yellow package, and the entire casino and hotel is in a yellow color.  So my wife didn't like the perfumy smell.  I didn't mind it, but it was thick - almost as if they were trying to hide something (cigarette smoke?)  \n\n5.  It's a bit of a pain in the ass to go from the parking garage to your hotel rooms as you have no choice but to walk through the ground floor of the casino.\n\n6.  The bowling alley here is awesome.  A [[little]] pricey at about $3 a game and $3.50 for shoes.  But it is professional level (not that I would know, but it seems it would be).\n\n7.  My wife went to see a movie.  Go on a Tuesday ($5).  Every other night is $11.  So a really nice cinema complex.\n\n8.  I used to play blackjack here, but the $5 tables were full of younger, drunker types, and my younger, drunker days are more than a decade ago.\n\n9.  I watched football in the Silverado Lounge to kill some time before my flight.  Nice arrangement of TVs, no pressure to buy either since you have to go to the bar for service.  $4 beers.\n\n10.  I ate at the Garden Buffet several years ago.  It was meh then.  Yelp reviews say it is still meh, and I wasn't in a mood to prove yelpers wrong.\n\n11.  Resort fee is $14.  This sucks, but all the resorts have them now, and on the strip they are around $25.  Did I mention this sucks?\n\n12.  I'm still a fan, and will utilize their facilities on my next vacation, but I did end up spending equal time at the M Resort on this visit.  (Good buffet, an older, laid back Blackjack crowd).

Back in 1994, my dad and his friend took me and my sisters to Nielsen's to try frozen custard for the first time.  From what I remember, it's more rich, much creamier than ice cream or frozen yogurt.  Since then, I've never been able to find anything that comes close to that creamy, custard-y frozen goodness.  Apparently it's not that common here on the west coast.\n\nLast I went back, because I had to have that smooth chocolate cone once more.  There was a wait, which wasn't uncommon, being summertime in the AridZone.  There wasn't a nice little old lady helping us; instead there were teenagers running about behind the counter.

Unfortunately, the [[custard]] itself was just not the same.\n\nIt [[tasted]] like plain ol' chocolate ice cream.

Worst ever! I typically like these restaurants but this one is horrible.  Waited forever for our food and had to ask for one item since it was forgotten in the steamer. Then we were rewarded with it being slammed into a basket and shoved at us by a sneering girl who worked at a snail's pace. The chips were stale and the entire seating area a filthy mess. They weren't busy, so there's no excuse for any of this.

We always wanted to go this place due to the fact that many other Hong Kong Chinese restaurants are really good and it seem like it was like a great authentic Chinese food place to go to.  This is by far the worst place i have ever been. \n I ordered the egg fu yung, it came with 3 patties, just green onions on top and gravy. no other vegetables or other condiments like I have at other places and worst of all it was burnt.\n We ordered Peking Pork Chops and it tasted like orange chicken, try figure. \nAnd last we ordered Seafood Chow fun, it was slimy and seafood was chewy, uncooked and no flavor what so ever.  \nThe top it all off, we were not offered any other drinks, server just gave us water that tasted so bad due to the fact probably because the glass cups were not washed well as you could see other lip stains. We all felt grossed out and sick after and my 3 year old daughter was nauseated  all the way home.  Me and my wife had a headache as well. Probably because, i presumed of the MSG and uncooked seafood and the overcooked egg fu yung.  \nLast, it was 105 degrees outside and I was sweating like a pig inside with there ceiling fans off and the A/C prob seem like it was set at 90 degrees.\nFirst and last time at this place.

There wasn't much to choose from.... no salad toppings for salads, incomplete good stations, lots of empty slots and not even chicken in the chicken fajitas pan. I checked. Twice. If you want GOOD quality, try Bayside Buffet in Mandalay Bay.  This food was bland, sad and not very tasty.

While I know this applies to all stores and not just this one it's worth pointing out that the prices listed on Books-A-Million's own website are NOT the same as the prices in store and they will [[NOT]] price [[match]] their own website or other websites either. A book I recently went in to purchase was a whopping $25 more in store ($59 instead of $39). One of the empolyees bluntly informed me this was to help fund her paycheck. [[Sorry]], I'll be helping someone at Amazon out with their paycheck instead.

If I was just reviewing the quality of the food, I would say four stars...but the overall experience I had at STK was essentially [[ruined]] by extraordinarily poor service.\n\nPacing was [[awful]].  We waited 15 minutes to get water.  We waited another 10 minutes after order wine.  The time from the time our salad plates were taken away to the arrival of our entrees was pushing 45 minutes.  \n\nThis was a Wednesday night at 9:30 p.m.  It was not busy.  I would never eat at STK on a weekend.  \n\nThe other thing that I have to mention is that this is a reasonably large restaurant with a single, private bathroom for men and a single, private bathroom for women.  I don't know how that meets building codes--but if you go to STK and have to use the restroom, do yourself a favor and leave the restaurant.  There are large public bathrooms just across the hall.  You will save yourself time and frustration...and you'll be waiting forever for your food, so you might as well get in a little exercise.

\""Greasy spoons\"" are called such for a reason, but when you have a pool of that yellow margarine stuff under your hash brown, it's too much.\n\nThe biscuits and gravy were no better than the ones at Whataburger, and the eggs are definitely not fresh eggs.\n\nBut the biggest letdown of all was the coffee, which was several hours old.

Worst company out there. I live in a community managed by ACM and it's a joke. They are rude and anytime you have a problem or complaint and call about it you will start getting letters saying that there are problems with our own property, in my case the letters were addressed to me but the pictures were of different properties not of mine. When I called to tell them it wasn't my house they treated me like I was lying. They've lost a money order I sent, and were never able to find it so I was out the payment and had to pay it again. I've lived in this community for years and our entire community is in agreement that we have the worst HOA management company ever. In fact the first time we ever received a \""community newsletter\"" from them was after our entire community received a letter from another home owner who wants to be voted onto the board so that we can find a new management company. In the 6 years prior we've only received our annual financial disclosure, meeting information, and plenty of \""violation alerts\"". I'm looking forward to having a better HOA management company, and I'm sure now that I've posted a review I'll get new violations for all sorts of imagined things, or problems on other properties, but that's ok. I'm getting smart about it and now keep a copy of everything I do and they do in return in a file marked HOA Management harassment so that my attorney can handle it. I'm just going to keep letting their harassments and incorrect violations and mistakes add up.

I [[usually]] don't like the old Marriott Suites. I just never did like the room layouts which is probably one of the reasons that they never took off. They are not set up for working. You usually can't sit at the desk and work while you watch TV. This one is a little different in that it is more of a vacation hotel then a business hotel. It is on one of the two TPC Scottsdale golf courses (not the one that has the Waste Management Tournament). It has a nice pool area, a great patio for dinning. Like all of the old Marriott Suites, it does not have a concierge lounge, but as a Platinum they provide free breakfast. Breakfast was good to very good.

I reviewed a message from the manager, Dawn, less than 24 hours from my first visit apologizing about the situation. I think it's great when a manager can admit to faults and grow themselves and their team from mistakes. I was not expecting her to reach out to me or invite me to come back for a great experience. I understand that mistakes happen and they are all teachable moments, it just depends on the accountability and ownership and their actions to rectify moving forward. I have accepted her invitation to come back and look forward to the great experience she guarantees I will have.

The wine bar looks nice, although I haven't personally tried it myself. Its hard to explain this spot, other than it is a Fry's on steroids. The food is a bit nicer, and each aisle or section has different higher end items that you just don't see elsewhere. This is Fry's answer to Whole Foods and Sprouts, yet at a Costco size level. You simply must go... like Nike, Just Do It.\n\n~The Bad~\nWELL..... If you need a [[scooter]], your battery might run out trying to see everything (I'm sorry about that God, that was my bad). If you [[loathe]] walking, in other words, then do not go here... All joking aside, the only negative I see is the location.

My cat was nervous, which is understandable because she is not used to leaving the house, and the groomer was immediately aggressive with her and was yelling at her.  My cat was quiet and docile just clearly nervous and the groomer said \""I can't do this cat\"" and sent us to the tropicana animal hospital down the street.

This will be concise: we requested a quote for my iPhone issues, and were immediately sent a text by the technician, Eric.  I wanted to support him because he is a UNLV grad and had good reviews.  He gave us a reasonable estimate but said he could not do the repair until the weekend was over because he was missing parts.  We told him never mind because we needed it done over the weekend.  He wrote back that he located the parts and gave us a time frame.  We agreed to a specific time and location on Sunday.  He said he would text us when he was on his way.\n\nWe never heard from him, so at the scheduled appointment time, we texted and called him.  We did not get a call back or a text back.  So he is unreliable and I still have a broken phone.  Don't waste your time.

The server, who looked Spanish, was horrible. So horrible, I realize I don't even know his name. He ignored me when I called to him and only raised his hand to acknowledge my call the second time around, without turning his head. When we were paying, he left the credit card machine with us, so we had to tear our own receipt, while he chatted with a larger group.There was not one smile. No introduction. No request for drinks. The food  left us desiring as well. Monotone tub of gnocchi. Pasta with meat sauce, fries and the calamari were good. Bruschetta was freshly made but just didn't have anything to it. Bread was cold but we were so hungry, bread dipped in evoo and pesto was good. The server experience really ruined our first night in montreal for that trip. I have been here many years ago and was hoping for the same fun night out but I guess things change.

I don't even want to give one star. Worst dining experience ever. EVER!! Got there at 700 p.m. ordered 2 waters, and an iced tea. Then the wait began....the waitress. ..rude and overworked...took our orders. There were only 3 of us. At 8:10 we were still sitting waiting for our burgers n fries. The waitresses were not anywhere to be found. I kept asking how much longer and she kept saying...I dont know..like...can you ask the cooks??? People were walking out left and right. The waitresses were meeting people at the door talking people out of staying. They told them to come back early afternoon when it is slower. What are we supposed to do for dinner tonight? They ran out of bacon, shoestring fries, pastrami, diet coke. Finally...we just left. I heard the waitresses apologizing to people with to go orders the whole time we sat there too. Never ever ever would I go here again. We were there for over an hour and in that time...only 1 table got their food. Get it together!  It is quite a drive in the middle of nowhere so I was hoping it would be a hidden gem. NOPE!!! This place has a lot to learn about running a restaurant and customer service. Save your gas!

This parking garage is conveniently located and clean.  I'm giving it a 1 star rating for the employees.  My wife and I went to 7th Street Public Market and the ticket validator wasn't working so on our way out we told the lady running the booth that it wouldn't scan our ticket.  She sent someone down to check it out.  He came back, anger in his face, and yelled through the window poking his finger against the ticket before shoving it back at her.  He had gotten it to work.  She then proceeded to tell us that we should have asked someone there to help (as in a shop employee) and not them (the parking garage people).  She also made it a point to tell us that when he tried it, it worked after the first try, as if we hadn't tried it at all.  The guy was no doubt irritated that someone asked him to stop lounging on his cart, staring at the sky, and do something.  She was obviously irritated that we didn't ask someone baking bread or making lattes to service the validator machine.  After we pointed out that he was being so rude, she squeaked out a half-hearted apology and still made it a point to reprimand us for asking for their assistance.\n\nI can't say I'll never park here again since it is a convenient lot (although extremely expensive if not shopping at the market) but I do hope to not have another uproar like this again, especially over something so simple.

[[Ruben]] and I were really excited when we first heard about the festival brewing and made sure to purchase wristbands on the first day it went on sale (06/07/13). Early bird prices were gone within seconds. I have a feeling there were just a couple available. Either way, we still scored the second lowest [[price]] of $119 for two-day access wristbands. Payment was due immediately and wristbands arrived mid-October, within a couple weeks of the festival. \n\nBoth days started at 10 a.m. and ended at midnight. A few blocks of Downtown Las Vegas were sectioned off for the big event with El Cortez Hotel & Casino and East Fremont in the midst. All-day parking and shuttles were available from select Strip hotels (Caesars Palace, Planet Hollywood, Bally's) and World Market Center on Grand Central Parkway, for $40 (for the weekend). Although the list of things you couldn't bring to the festival (NO umbrellas, lounge chairs, coolers) was much longer than the list of things you could bring, we were [[extremely]] [[grateful]] that they allowed two (2) factory-sealed one-liter water bottles per attendee. \n\nWe were fortunate to have a ride to and from the festival grounds on both days. It still sucked. It was just such a nuisance for all parties involved. There will be a better way next year (without spending an additional $40). We prepared for our long days with a backpack and small crossbody purse filled with four Smart Water liter bottles for each day (need those electrolytes!), snacks, small towels, blanket, chapstick, cash, and sunscreen lotion (non-aerosol). It all paid off, so I highly recommend these items! Dress comfortably too since it was pretty warm during the day and bring a jacket for the evenings.\n\nMusic: We loved it. Ruben is a really big fan of alternative music, so he was pretty stoked about the line-up. It helped that we planned and mapped out our attack since there was so much going on at the same time. Plus, the stages were not close to each other; good for the experience, bad for the legs/feet. We were able to catch most or all of Youngblood Hawke, Capital Cities, Imagine Dragons, Childish Gambino, Janelle Monae, Passion Pit, Vampire Weekend, and The Killers. Some acts overlapped others, so we had to rush from one stage to the next, but the last three acts of the second day were back-to-back at the same stage, so we were lucky and had amazing spots near the stage! The bands were all great, but some stood out more than others. Youngblood Hawke were much better than I expected, Imagine Dragons and Vampire Weekend had rad performances (loved the Cirque du Soleil collaboration with ID) and The Killers were really freakin' awesome!\n\nThe various attractions were also fun: signing the gigantic inaugural festival banner, decorating bricks for The Wall, shooting a paintball gun at cardboard designs (bonus, free shirt!), various heart sculptures, the amazing murals and other art pieces on various buildings, the \""Art of Beer\"" Garden where local artists, Giovanni Morales and LeslieAnn Farrell were live painting, the Learning Stage with notable speakers like Las Vegas' own Tony Shieh, and the Culinary Village that featured famous chefs and local eateries (Nobu, Payard, Fleur, DOCG Enoteca, Honey Salt).\n\nWe didn't end up eating anything (except nameless tent garlic fries) since the offerings weren't extremely exciting and I figured if I really wanted to eat something, I could go to their respective restaurants. So, we ate before and after the festival and enjoyed a couple beverages (fresh fruit smoothies and beer, mmm). Oh, and random, but the port-a-potties were great! Most were placed under tents, placed in several areas of the festival grounds, well-kept, and I appreciated the portable sinks very much (complete with soap and paper towels!). Overall, a fun and memorable event. I haven't been to any other large festivals, so I don't really have any comparison. This is also coming from someone that doesn't really enjoy all-day outdoor engagements (I have the same feelings toward amusement parks). It's exhausting. After two days of standing, walking, and really crowded spaces, I was very tired. The most important thing is, would I go again next year? The answer is yes.

I did not like eating here! Food was below-average quality. Sushi had no flavor - the only thing you can taste is the mayo sauce they squeeze all over ALL of the rolls. The Mongolian BBQ has no flavor (there's no sauces for you to choose like at a real MBBQ joint), lots of fried food (cheap), what fresh fish they did have (shrimp) I just didn't trust. Service makes you feel like you're an imposition. Signs all over the walls about the ramifications if you waste food. Jeeze. Never going here again.

Place is a disaster. My brother, dad, and I were walking around at noon during ASU's homecoming festivities. In the middle of the day they have a bouncer at the door checking ID's. I just laughed when he asked for my ID because I thought it was a joke and he just let me walk right past him, it was weird. Why would they only let 21 over in a sports bar in the middle of the day on one of the busiest days on mill all year?\n\nOnce inside we had no one greeting us so we just sat at the first table we saw. They had a few tv's that were all on soccer games which seemed odd for a college football town on a Saturday, and 50 feet from a college football stadium.  There were also a bunch of neon signs on the wall with just the cords hanging down from them not plugged in or anything, it looked like they tried moving in and opening that morning.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes a waitress came and asked if we wanted to order anything. We asked for menus and she said, \""We don't have any\"". We all laughed at the absurdity of it and she said,\""I'll be your menu\"". So we asked her what kind of foods they had, to which she started sarcastically listing off foods, \""We have wings, 6,12,24; we have burgers; fries....\"" We interrupted her and just asked for 3 burgers and 3 bud lights. After 15 minutes of sitting there with no beer or burgers or acknowledgment from anyone, we just got up and left. \n\nHorrible management and it's clear this place won't be around for long. Hopefully the next place and ownership will be worth giving another try.

This was after the [[man]] in [[front]] of me ordered \""JUST\"" a [[cheese]] [[pizza]]. Shame on him!! LOL! I sat in the very nice little restaurant watching a DVD of wonderful shots of Italy while I waited for my food to arrive. After about 15 minutes i was told it was ready so I took it out to my car and headed home. I could not wait to try something so I reached into the tin where the soft warm bread was and took a bite. Ok, something is different, there is none of the \""tap water\"" taste I tasted before. This bread was very good. I got home and my mother and I dug into the pizza and pasta. IT WAS AMAZING!!!! Every single bite was fantastic. My mother doesn't really rave about food, the only way I can tell if she really likes it is she tends to inhale it in a matter of seconds.

He had a strong Italian accent and [[complied]] myself and the customer before me in with how NOT to order a cheese pizza. \""Cheese is a family not just one topping\"" he says with [[amateur]]. This was after the [[male]] in [[confronts]] of me ordered \""JUST\"" a [[spaghetti]] [[spaghetti]]. Shame on him!! LOL! I sat in the very nice little restaurant watching a DVD of wonderful shots of Italy while I waited for my food to arrive. After about 15 minutes i was told it was ready so I took it out to my car and headed home. I could not wait to try something so I reached into the tin where the soft warm bread was and took a bite. Ok, something is different, there is none of the \""tap water\"" taste I tasted before. This bread was very good. I got home and my mother and I dug into the pizza and pasta. IT WAS AMAZING!!!! Every single bite was fantastic. My mother doesn't really rave about food, the only way I can tell if she really likes it is she tends to inhale it in a matter of seconds. Well, she finished her dinner in record time. I could not [[feel]] how fantastic this was. So much different from how it was the first time. I rescind my last opinion and will be back tonight for another wonderful meal. I recommend PAM to everyone and thanks again to whoever reminded me that everyone deserves a second chance.\n      \n    Thanks, C.K.

I recently entertained clients here.  I made my reservation over Open Table.  Originally I had made for 4 people, then wanted to add one more guest.  They told me several times that there was no way they could fit another chair at the table.  Ok.\n\nWe get there, and there is a private party going on - but in the lobby/bar/wait area.  What?  That's a bit disturbing.  They sat us in the lounge area and we ordered drinks (which never came).  Then our \""table\"" was ready.  Well this was the end table which basically was in the lounge area.  So we moved over one table. \n\nThe wine list is very in depth and almost overwhelming.  Just give me a good red with my meat is not the way to go here.  No simplicity.\n\nFrom the start our table was crowded.  Too many items on the tables, and the service ware was oversized for the little table.  It almost made it difficult to eat.\n\nBefore our food came I wondered off to the loo - which was like a hike because the restaurant is actually quite huge.  As I walked by tables, I saw several larger tables with less people seated at them and empty chairs.  Hmmm.  So they really couldn't let me bring an extra guest or they really don't know how to plan their seating?  \n\nDuring our meal we couldn't even talk - the noise from the private party was too much.  And they were standing all around us.  Several time people knocked into the back of my clients' chair!  So [[frustrating]].  I can't understand WHY they would seat people in that area - and we had plenty of room for the extra guest.  \n\nThe food was wonderful.  Meat done right.

Me and my plus one were supposed to be VIP on Friday night and had it all setup for no cover, bottle service and the entire VIP service and treatment but when arriving we were told to pay the cover of $20 each and after doing so we were told that the open bar was only till midnight and that they knew nothing of the arrangement with the VIP management, even when showing the email from the person we were told we still had to pay for drinks and I can say we left after getting a refund of the $40 of cover. Early that morning I got an apologetic email and was told that they wanted to make it right and to come back the next night Saturday and we did, after a long irritating mixup of who was providing the driver to is to and from the club and when we got there they told us they had been told about our bottle service of only paying the 20% gratuity per bottle and that was gonna be about $20 for a $100 bottle and yet told to pay the $40 cover for two of us and we just left and went to The Cosmopolitan to their clubs and got the VIP treatment same night when mentioning we were going to drop money on drinks the petty cover didn't matter. I would say to avoid this place and go to another venue that is gay off the strip. Just because it is on the strip doesn't mean that it is a good venue!

I am a Vegas local and have stayed here on two previous occasions.  Both times were with Groupon/Living Social deals and I was very happy.\n\nFast forward to a month ago when I purchased another Groupon for a Spa package and hotel stay.  \n\nThe first time I called to book a date, I was told their reservation system was down and that a Supervisor would call me back the following day.  No call back.  I tried again a few days later and was told that they did not have the correct codes to book the Groupon.  I was also told a Supervisor would call me back.  No call back.  I again tried a few days later and was the told the same thing.  They did not have the correct Groupon codes to make a reservation?????   I was again told a Manager would be contacting me immediately.  A Manager did not call.\n\nMy next call was to Groupon.  I was immediately refunded my Groupon purchase and told that others had experienced problems as well.\n\nBuyer beware.  Not sure what is going on here.  A shame really considering it is a really nice Hotel.

As a new arrival to Phoenix from Miami, I needed to quickly find somewhere to cheer the Heat on to inevitable victory, as much as Pop and the Spurs are appealing underdogs.\n\nArcadia was the second place the wife and I tried, Zipps being the [[first]]. It's a [[pleasant]], casual, sports bar with a little less emphasis on the Sports than Zipps and a little more emphasis on restaurant than bar. We seemed like the only people there for the game, everyone else was there for food. There's no sound on during the game, which for an avid sports fan may be disappointing, but is probably nice for everyone else. There's a cool little area stocked with toys for kids, in case you're a kid or have them.\n\nThe food is obviously why people come. A long list of big, juicy, gourmet burgers will present you, the famished patron, with a gastronomical quandary. The solution is to order the Spinach and Artichoke Dip to allow another few minutes of salivated staring at the menu. The Spinach and Artichoke Dip is pretty good, as spinach and artichoke dips tend to be.\n\nThere is also a suckier quandary to be found here. The short list of light, tepid beers on draft is a [[little]] disappointing. I'm not going to complain too much, but there's plenty of room for improvement on the beer list. All in all Arcadia is a fun little restaurant for the casual sports fan.

My brunch club was super excited to try this place out and we all [[loved]] it!!  The upstairs was tiny and for a group of nine wasn't looking good but they were able to seat us in the downstairs section-much more room to spread out. I wish this place took reservations.  They are BYOB which is awesome. For brunch were we not drinking but they had a variety of teas.  We started with their well known homemade donuts. These were [[amazing]]. We tired the chocolate espresso (much more chocolate than coffee flavor which I liked), the salt/pepper for a nice savory treat (not my favorite) and the lavender lemon which was delicious!  I want to go back and try more. For my entr\u00e9e I had the goat cheese omelet (without mushrooms and they happily did this for me) with a small salad and red potatoes. The service was great and there was 9 of us. The food is [[delicious]] and I can't [[wait]] to go back for dinner.

Oh my God. Okay so we had no intention to go here but we were in Planet Hollywood for a comedy show on a Sunday night. We were approached by a man and he told us to check it out for free entry and one complimentary drink. We thought why not. So we go in to get our drink and the bartender said no free drink and was so rude about it, it was shocking. He wouldn't even look at us, just kept acting snotty and shaking his head no. It was the weirdest thing. Our wristbands even said one complimentary drink right on it and we showed him but he just kept saying no, without an explanation of why or anything. So odd and rude. Anyway I told the door man of the issue and he said we had to get a drink ticket and he radioed down and talks with someone and then says to me that he was sorry but since it was slow they were not doing it! WTF?? wow.\n\nWe decided to stay anyway and purchase a drink. Again, rudest treatment ever from that bartender. I think the receipt said his name was Humberto or something like that. He still would not even look at us and just had a mean expression on his face. Worst treatment I have ever had!. Not one smile, not one hello, not even one word spoken to us or even acknowledgment. We left that area and went by the dance floor and it was pretty dead. However it started picking up as the night went on. Still not busy by night club standards, but it was a Sunday that might be why. \n\nEvery time we would set our drink down it would disappear!  Seriously someone kept cleaning away our full drinks if they were even left for a second (not alone, there was a group of us) or if we even turned our back at all, bam drink was gone. At $12 a drink, that was extremely upsetting, and again, weird!\n\nTerrible service. The employees in this establishment will be it's downfall.

Instead, she brought me back a new slip for the actual total.  I asked her for the cancellation on the original slip, and she said it wasn't required.  Not sure why I have this niggling feeling I was double-charged.  \n\nRegardless, overall, a [[lousy]] experience,  We'll stick with the PJ at Fashion Square.

This place was just not good, that's all there is to it.  I waited for 30 minutes on a very slow Monday afternoon, and their thoughts were to stick me at a chair and let my feet soak.  Lukewarm water ten minutes into the waiting, I knew this was a lost cause.  The place was not inviting, I thought the interior was very tacky, trying way too hard.  Pedicure was rough, not hurtful, just not gentle and very rushed.  Manicure same thing, very very rushed.

All you can eat and drink?! Oh yeah!! I've been waiting to try this place for so long. The drive is 10miles from the strip but well worth it. I came here for the Saturday brunch with my boys. We ate and drank up a storm. This place is really big and well lit up. The number of foods to choose from were out of this world. I'll recommend some of my favorite things to eat.\n\nSalmon sushi: Some pieces were beautifully fatty. I ate loads of this and threw away the rice. \n\nPrime rib: When you get a fatty one thats cooked medium rare then it's awesome. So juicy and tender. \n\nMimosa: endless amounts of champagne and oj. I left this place stumbling! \n\nSmoked Salmon bagels: Seriously the salmon here is too good! This normally would cost $10 for one.

I'm only giving it a 2 star because I absolutely think Paradise bakery is idiotically overpriced. Yes, the food is good but we had a breakfast sandwich and a small salad...no chicken, two drinks and it was almost 18 dollars. \nMy husband had a mozzarella and tomato sandwich and I had the SW Cesar salad. I really like this salad but again this place is completely over priced for a sandwich shop. \nMaybe if they reduced all their items by $1.00 and not run their a/c unit as if they were chilling meat...it maybe a bit more bearable.

This place was amazing. Made reservations on a Saturday night before Penn & Teller but didn't really need them because we got there earlier.

Over priced and overrated. While I admit the butternut squash ravioli was enjoyable, the calamari was flavorless rubber and the tiramisu was lackluster at best. Randall and Andrew are wonderful servers, but I found Gaetano himself to be incredibly off-putting. I've also heard tell that he has a tendency to treat his employees with disrespect, and as a former service industry employee myself, I take serious issue with that. Overall, not an establishment I care to patronize again.

Since it was my first time trying Hokkaido, I decided to try the Hokkaido Symphony Land and Sea combination plate. It came with filet mignon, scallops, lobster, and vegetables. It was amazing! It's a bit expensive, but you get an a lot of excellent mix of high-quality beef and seafood. \n\nChef Luong is very friendly and entertaining. He creates an awesome dining experience coupled with the delicious food he makes. The restaurant atmosphere is inviting and it shows that they thought about every piece of the design and its place.\n\nI highly recommend checking it out.

The service was very friendly and they get most of their stars for that. The menu was fairly limited compared to some of the other pho/Vietnamese food restaurants.  The check in offer was a free order of egg rolls. Since we came early in the AM, he had to check if they had any prepared yet. Turns out they did, and they were fresh and delicious. But, unfortunately I am pretty sure they ended up charging us for it. The pho was bland and extremely forgettable. I really fail to see where these high ratings are stemming from. They skimped on everything AND the broth tasted like hot water until I added sriracha, then it tasted like sriracha water. The bathroom looked like it doubled as a broom closet. I don't have any reason to go back or recommend this place to friends.

O my goodness gratuitous I am and was incredibly disappointed by the way this place is managed and run. Never have I had such terrible service but what makes it worst is that it was from multiple people (including the manager) WOW!! Only reason this place has 2 stars and not 1 is becasue it is located in a cool hotel. No way no how will not ever stop by at this place again. Incredibly rude and unhelpful people. I was appalled at the way the manager or supervisor lady we spoke to runs this place. We walked by on the weekend of my birthday before heading back to LA around 11:30am on a Sunday and was told by the hostess that they were currently not seating anyone and to check back in about 20 minutes. We tried to ask if we can just sit at a table and have a drink but again she was persistant with more or less the same answer but in a much more rude way.  So we took a walk around Mandalay for a bit then upon our return around 12 we were told the same thing. At this point we were a bit frustrated and mad so we asked to speak to their manager. The lady came out and explained to us that they were changing cooks so could not seat anyone. But not only that in a very rude and snarky type of way, almost as if speaking and explainng was painful. We just wanted to sit out by the patio area and have a few drinks and people watch. But apperantly thats way to much to ask for these people. We finally ended up getting a table after somewhat of a heated confrontation from the bitter clueless manager. We had a few drinks and bought a few bread items/pastries from inside but could definitely feel the unpleasent welcome. How difficult is it to say sorry the kitchen is currently closed but if you wish to sit outside and enjoy some drinks go ahead. I mean geez it is freaking VEGAS how can you deny people drinks, she was very clear and did not want to let us sit in the patio table area she said we could sit at the bar but I guess customer service and making money is not exactly their first priority here... If I were the owner or person in charge I would seriously think about training the employees better. I know the hostess was just following directions but one would expect a person such as the female manager/supervisor to be a bit more competent with customer service as apposed to chasing money away. Will definitley tell everyone I know that is going to Vegas (specificly Mandalay Bay) to avoid this place like the plague.

This restaurant consistently lacks any type of service whatsoever. I did not realize picking up an order for my friend can create confusion with the staff. Whoever took the order did not even place the order. Instead of telling me to patiently wait and that they will rush the order, they just looked at each other confused and pretended I was not there. I told one of the server to \""forget it.\"" Instead of stopping me, perhaps offering a drink while I wait for them to rush the order, they just let me walk out. I guess business is not needed in this town that you would not do anything when a customer walks out unsatisfied.

I was excited to compare this buffet with the one at Main Street in Old Vegas (Downtown).  So I roll in and notice that it was a lot cleaner that is for sure.  But the taste of disappointment filled my mouth when I took my first bite.  There were two things that help salvage this place from getting a one star review.  The first was how good the service was.  Finally the dessert station was crazy good.  They had mini donuts, cookies, cakes, pies (excuse me I had to wipe the drool from my mouth), ice cream, and flippin cotton candy!  \n\nIf you have bland taste buds then this place is for you.

The first time I experienced The Eggery was for a business lunch in their back meeting room. As I walked through the restaurant, I was surprised it was so busy...I mean this IS a breakfast place, right? \n\nThe decor is very [[outdated]] with knick knack cutter EVERYWHERE. I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this place. \n\nI ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a [[disappointment]]! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food. \n\nYesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church. Maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch. Same awful decor, but it seemed a bit more charming at 10:30am. \n\nI had the Berry Blintz Crepes which were pretty good. Stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt, mixed berries, cottage cheese, and a little bit of cream cheese. Whipped cream, toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes. It seemed like a lot of food for $7.50, a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad. \n\nI am not in any hurry to [[return]] to the Eggery, although my business group meets there every week.

The first time I experienced The Eggery was for a business lunch in their back meeting room. As I walked through the restaurant, I was surprised it was so busy...I mean this IS a breakfast place, right? \n\nThe decor is very [[immemorial]] with knick knack cutter EVERYWHERE. I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this place. \n\nI ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a [[disappoint]]! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food. \n\nYesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church.

On a recent visit to Las Vegas, I visited this restaurant for lunch. Although, I wanted to enjoy the food and ambiance, I was thoroughly disappointed. The salad bar spread was limited and not as fresh as I've experienced in other Brazilian restaurants. Furthermore, the meats offered were limited and the beef offerings overcooked. Needless to say, I won't be visiting this place the next time I'm in town.\n\nOn a positive note, the restaurant was clean, service was good, and the staff was friendly. Lunch prices were decent considering the spread offered.

Handmade popsicles done extraordinarily well. An amazingly cute concept...a Popsicle shop located in one of the hottest places on Earth. The staff is always warm and welcoming, and patient as you go through the menu (and learn a little Espanol in the process). \n\nMy favorite is the mango con chile. Spicy and sweet with fresh chunks of mango. A perfect treat on a hot day. My kids love the fresca con crema (strawberries and cream) or the mexican chocolate. A new one I tried today was the lemon pie...a take on the key lime with a graham cracker crust layer...spectacular!\n\nI read some reviews complaining about the price. We spend $4 on coffee drinks every day, so this treat seems about right in the grand scheme given the homemade natural ingredients. Bravo to this local gem!

Tropical [[themed]] restaurant.  Been here for buffets which were decent.  Wanting to avoid the long buffet line, we opted to be seated for the cafe.  Getting seats for 6 seemed to be a challenge.  We were directed to the back and was told someone would be waiting for us to seat us.  Alas, no one was so we just seated ourselves.  What appeared to be confusion as another server asked us if we were supposed to be seated there or not.  Turns out, it was the right place.  Anyway, we [[waited]]....hmmmm... quite a while.  It seemed longer withTWO antsy toddlers who weren't shy about declaring their state of hunger.  The waiter hurriedly walked by and said he'd be right there.  He appeared to be on the verge of a hissy fit.   \nWe waited AGAIN even longer.  Finally, annoyed with the wait since we had just arrived to Vegas after roadtripping 5 hours, I walked over to the waiter station and asked for someone to bring us drinks.  \nA minute later, our huffy server shows up with no [[greeting]] and asks us for our drink order.  We were already ready to order.  \nAgain,  [[another]] long [[wait]].  I looked at my watch and noticed it's been over 20 [[minutes]] with NO DRINKS!  This has been my [[worst]] [[experience]] at the Fremont Hotel.  Again, I walked over to the wait station and asked for assistance. \nAbout another few minutes go by and then our drinks arrive.  No [[apology]] or explanation about the delay.  \nThen our food arrives.  Now, the food was ok.  The American cuisine was pretty good.   But how do you screw up a patty melt or fried saimin noodles anyway? The Asian iterations could have been better.  The Korean ribs were not authentic.  Ok,if you like your bbq really sweet or never had true Korean marinated ribs.  \nWe noticed patrons who arrived long after us who already received their drinks and their food arrived at about the same time as ours.  NICE....\nWhile we were finishing up our food, the server tells us he's going on a break and that \""so and so\"" would take care of us.  Well it was a while before we saw this person since usually, we're introduced to the new server.\nAnyway, this new server couldnt have been nicer.  She had a friendly disposition and almost simulataneously, hubby and I exclaimed we should have had her as our server plus our original server was going on a break?   It appeared he went on a break while we waited for our drinks.  Funny thing is, we devoured our food and was out of there so soon after we received our entrees.   \nThe new server was more empathatic and tried to explain how slammed they were with a new cook and that the previous patrons gave our server a difficult time.  My point was that it doesnt take THAT long to bring drinks and explain the situation.  Plus, why are we being punished because of other high maintenance sh**heads!!!  If the food was really crappy, I would give 1 star but the buffets I've experienced in the past were decent.

Definitely Not good service. Didnt ask if we needed shoe rentals and didnt explain anything special. The cashier forgot to ring us up for one person and our lane jammed halfway through the game. I went up to ask the desk if they could fix the jam. The person at the register at this point (ended up he is the manager!!) was very rude and just started yelling at me that we didnt pay for enough people. Im sorry I honestly just signed the receipt not looking at the price and had no clue that we had only paid for three people. I didnt even know the computer would allow you to play more people than paid for. He was extemely rude and did not want to fix the lanes. At this point I didnt even want to finish playing because he instantly assumed I was purposely not paying. In the customer service industry, the customer is always right and you should be nice to them if you want good reviews. I will definitely not be going back here.

I like to eat at Pura and I bring all my non vegan friends/family all the time... I don't mind the 1 hour wait for the food... I even think the waitresses are nice.   I want to support a restaurant that is cruelty free.\n\nBut something happened today when i went to eat there... I ordered pancakes, and the table next to me ordered pancakes too.  Now, I was there before that table sat down and ordered.  So i'm waiting very patiently for my food ( i am waiting an hour)  when finally the waitress put my pancakes on my table.  As soon as I was gonna dig in, the other waitress comes and takes it off my table and says it's for the table next to me.  My waitress asked me if I had that same order and i said yes.  She then came back to tell me that since a kid ordered pancakes.. they want to get food out to the kids first.  I just thought that was the stupidest reason ever!!! I was like WTF.  What restaurant does that?  I don't care who ordered pancakes... i ordered first!  I'm grouchy when I'm hungry :)  (Imagine waiting an hour for your food, only to have the table next you who order after you.. get your food)   This just turned me off!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI don't know what to say about this incident.  I think I'm going to take a break from Pura for awhile. :(

I adopted a dog a few months ago. She is a 3 year old border collie lab mix named Lily. I know when the dogs are given up the humane society relies on the former family being honest about the dogs behavior. I was [[told]] she was a friendly, sweet lap dog that has never had issues with other animals. She gets along with my cat great, but when other dogs come along on walks she flips out. She even attacked one recently. I'm positive she was abused by her previous family. Cchs didn't take great care of her either. Her pads were all torn in her front paws, which had her limping for the first few weeks, her gums bled like crazy and her teeth were in [[awful]] condition, and she was too skinny.

Re Threads is well-organized, clean, and chockful of bargains both designer and regular. Sure, some of the stuff may be a bit pricier than Goodwill, but I dig the philosophy behind Re Threads-- the clothes are not donated to them, nor are they sold on consignment, per se; rather, they pay people in either store credit or cash up front.  I've never sold stuff to them, but I have friends who have, and that's worth a small premium to me.    \n\nI've found Camper shoes with the tags still on them for $19 (retail value: $170 via Piperlime), an Anthropologie dress for $17, and Born knee high boots for $16, among many other deals.   I think perhaps its prime real estate leads to it being more \""picked over\"" than St. Vinnie's or Goodwill, but in general the selection rotates frequently enough for me. \n\nFinally, I wanted to comment on their staff.  On a recent trip into the store, I saw one of the cashiers going out of his way to assist a disabled shopper, basically acting as a personal shopper and bringing things over at the customer's request, helping him find what he needed, etc. From what I overheard, he did this completely voluntarily.  At the same time, the other cashier (perhaps a manager on duty?) was politely and respectfully listening to two homeless people pitch what sounded like adspace for Street Pulse (a newspaper that the homeless volunteer to sell on the street-- some of the money goes directly to them).

[[Do]] not go to this urgent care center if you value you or your family's health or even life. \n\nMy family and I were in Las Vegas for vacation last week. On Saturday, I took my two years old to that place since he is having fever for a couple of days and we could not bring the fever down with Tylenol. The doctor there could not see what inside my son's ears clearly and my son did not want to open his month either for the doctor to see his throat. The doctor then said \""let just give him some antibiotics for precaution\"".  I told the doctor that we will leave Las Vegas for home the second day.  I told him there are CVS and walgreen near the hotel we stay. I took the prescription to both CVS and walgreen and none of them carry this antibiotics! The lady in walgreen said they have to order this if I really want it. It seems the doctor has no idea what the pharmacy normally carry. This is not the worst part yet.\n\nI called the doctor and asked for a replacement antibiotics. The nurse said they can not fax the new prescription to me. it is their policy not to do this. I have to either go there to pick it up or ask the pharmacy to call them. I did not rent a car so I decided to ask the pharmacy to give him a call.\n\nThe lady in walgreen called the doctor. it seemed the doctor yelled at her over the phone. she said the doctor is mean and prefer not to talk to him any more. Anyway, the new prescription asked for 200mg azithromycin. My son needs to take it twice a day and 5ml each time. The lady in the walgreen said she only has four bottles of this type of medicine and each only only has 22.5mg. I was surprised that the total amount of antibiotics my son has to take. So, I questioned the doctor over the phone. I had to wait two hours to get a chance to take to the nurse. The nurse said the doctor said it is correct! I [[still]] had [[doubt]] [[since]] [[even]] my [[insurance]] [[said]] the [[maximum]] is .75 [[something]](?) and special [[manual]] [[override]] is [[needed]] if more is [[prescribed]] by the [[doctor]].  [[Then]] the [[doctor]] [[said]] he [[wants]] to [[talk]] to the [[pharmacist]]. I gave my phone to the pharmacist. I guess the doctor yelled at her again. The pharmacist asked me why I was trying to give her a hard time? I was surprised by her question. All I want to do is to verify the total amount of antibiotics is correct and don't want to overdose my son. In the end, I said I only need two days' worth and I will get the rest when I get back home. For whatever reason, she gave me two bottles which is four days' worth. (about 45mg total). \n\nA couple of days after I got back home, I took my son to his regular pediatrics since he is still having cough and also I was wondering if I need to get the rest antibiotics from walgreen. fortunately, I did take him to his pediatrics. The pediatrics said the concentra doctor clearly did not know what he is doing and need to go back to school to learn again. for this type of antibiotics and for my son's age, he only need to take one teaspoon (5ml) a day for five days (total 25ml). Since my son has been taking the antibiotics for almost three days (30ml), we should stop give him more antibiotics. He had enough already. This antibiotics he took will stay and last for another several days. \n\nThe doctor in concentra asked my son to take  4~5 times more antibiotics than he should. It is insane. Also, his attitude to the pharmacist in walgreen was really bad. I hope there is something I can do to stop him from hurting other people. To leave a proper review here, I think, is the least I can do for now.

The doctor then said \""let just give him some antibiotics for precaution\"".  I told the doctor that we will leave Las Vegas for home the second day.  I told him there are CVS and walgreen near the hotel we stay. I took the prescription to both CVS and walgreen and none of them carry this antibiotics! The lady in walgreen said they have to order this if I really want it. It seems the doctor has no idea what the pharmacy normally carry. This is not the worst part yet.\n\nI called the doctor and asked for a replacement antibiotics. The nurse said they can not fax the new prescription to me. it is their policy not to do this. I have to either go there to pick it up or ask the pharmacy to call them. I did not rent a car so I decided to ask the pharmacy to give him a call.\n\nThe lady in walgreen called the doctor. it seemed the doctor yelled at her over the phone. she said the doctor is mean and prefer not to talk to him any more. Anyway, the new prescription asked for 200mg azithromycin. My son needs to take it twice a day and 5ml each time. The lady in the walgreen said she only has four bottles of this type of medicine and each only only has 22.5mg. I was surprised that the total amount of antibiotics my son has to take. So, I questioned the doctor over the phone. I had to wait two hours to get a chance to take to the nurse. The nurse said the doctor said it is correct! I [[though]] had [[hesitation]] [[tad]] [[but]] my [[confident]] [[proclaimed]] the [[finest]] is .75 [[somehow]](?) and special [[guiding]] [[replacement]] is [[pivotal]] if more is [[needs]] by the [[physicist]].  [[Besides]] the [[medici]] [[expressed]] he [[envy]] to [[drooling]] to the [[medicine]]. I gave my phone to the pharmacist. I guess the doctor yelled at her again. The pharmacist asked me why I was trying to give her a hard time? I was surprised by her question. All I want to do is to verify the total amount of antibiotics is correct and don't want to overdose my son. In the end, I said I only need two days' worth and I will get the rest when I get back home. For whatever reason, she gave me two bottles which is four days' worth. (about 45mg total). \n\nA couple of days after I got back home, I took my son to his regular pediatrics since he is still having cough and also I was wondering if I need to get the rest antibiotics from walgreen. fortunately, I did take him to his pediatrics. The pediatrics said the concentra doctor clearly did not know what he is doing and need to go back to school to learn again. for this type of antibiotics and for my son's age, he only need to take one teaspoon (5ml) a day for five days (total 25ml). Since my son has been taking the antibiotics for almost three days (30ml), we should stop give him more antibiotics. He had enough already. This antibiotics he took will stay and last for another several days. \n\nThe doctor in concentra asked my son to take  4~5 times more antibiotics than he should. It is insane. Also, his attitude to the pharmacist in walgreen was really bad. I hope there is something I can do to stop him from hurting other people. To leave a proper review here, I think, is the least I can do for now.

It's gourmet pizza people, they put it in the name of the restaurant.  If you don't like gourmet pizza, don't go to a place called \""... Gourmet Pizza\""\n\nWe've been to this location a few of times.  The pizza is great.  We've opted for their special pizzas each time.  But most memorable has been the baked brie and roasted garlic appetizer.  If you like garlic and you haven't had a whole roasted garlic you need to try one.  \n\nThe value for this place is ok it's not carry out after all.  The prices are about $15-$20 per adult at our table.  If I remember correctly our last visit was 4 adults and 2 toddlers.  One app + One large salad to share +a drink or two + a large pizza came out to 70 and we were well full.\n\nI also have to applaud a place for using their brains when applying policy.  They have a happy hour which is, by policy, for their small bar area at the high top tables.  We really wanted to sit at a table and watch a game on TV so they let us and ave us the happy hour prices there.  It seems like a no-brainer for an empty restaurant in this economy but the restaurant next door would not budge in the same situation, so kudos to Picazzo's staff for having basic business sense.

[[Disappointing]] does not begin to describe my experience at MM Vegas.\nLet me preface this review by saying I am a HUGE Mina fan. I've [[dined]] many times at both [[Stonehill]] Tavern (Monarch Beach) and XIV (Los Angeles), and have flown to San Francisco on more than one occasion  for the sole purpose of devouring plates of Mina's fantasmic creations. \n\nWe came here for a late dinner after seeing a show. We had had an AMAZING meal -- more like experience -- at Alex (Wynn) the night before, so I was looking forward to continuing the good times. First off, decor. \""Understated\"" to some = Boring Bob to me. \""Cozy\"" to others = \""Where is the other half of the restaurant?\"" to me. This was, after all, Vegas. \n\nThe menu...*yawn*. Everything on the cookbook and a la carte menus was way too familiar -- nothing new or creative. Two of the items on the seasonal tasting menu seemed interesting, but there was a noticeable absence of a trio dish (MM's signature), which my friend wanted to try. I looked at my watch and it was 9:30 pm, which was too late for a course meal (walking into a club, expanded tummy from course meal = so NOT cute), so I agreed to order a few dishes a la carte.\n\nAmuse bouche: Truffle mousse with pear. 2 [[stars]].\n\nBread: Wheat roll and sourdough. Boris boringballs. \n\nTuna tartare: I've had this dish a million times (MM SF, Stonehill, slightly different version at XIV) and a million times I've loved it. Here, the presentation was the same, the taste was NOT. It was lacking seasoning -- I had to ask for sea salt (I rarely ever do this). \n\nMarket salad: Good. Nothing mind blowing (I didn't expect this from a salad anyways).\n\nMiso-glazed sea bass: This dish was served with small squash balls which had been sitting in a freezer. How did I know this? They were cold. Like, awkwardly [[COLD]]. [[I]] didn't [[even]] [[bother]] [[telling]] the [[waiter]] (more on this later). The accompanying dumpling, simply put, was gross. The bass was good, a little salty. I finished half of the dish.\n\nSurf and Turf Trio: Kobe and lobster were pretty standard, as were the crab and filet. Langoustine had a foul taste. \n\nDessert: Never even got to see a menu (keep reading).\n\nNow, the service. I'd received anything but remarkable service at MM restaurants prior to this meal; here, the service was liken that to which you would expect to receive at an IHOP. Before I get into any more detail, I want to point out that there wasn't a lack of waitstaff around the restaurant. There were at least seven servers near the kitchen, talking amongst themselves during the entire meal. Still, I never got my water refilled. Not once. In fact, I ordered another bottle of sparkling water, and PAID for it, but never got a drip of it. On top of that, I stared at dirty plate after dirty plate up until the moment the next one arrived. In fact, our entree plates were still sitting at out table when we left the restaurant. This is a HUGE peeve of mine. Once my table finishes a course, I will wait up to five minutes (it's much longer than it seems), before I start to get antsy. Here, we waited over FIFTEEN minutes after we finished our main course, before I threw in the towel and just asked for the check. The most ridiculous part: the manager, a semi-bald man wearing a bad suit, brought over the bill and a small plate of complementary dessert (this is custom at MM restaurants) and sat it down on our tables, right next to our dirty plates. This behavior from an inept waiter I can grasp my head around, but from a manager? Needless to say, we didn't touch the dessert plate and left.

My first plate was lau lau and second plate was a combo with half bbq chicken and lau lau (simple right?) Not for her.\n\nMy bf came home with our food the order was correct. Now the lau lau.... where do I start with this? The lau lau was SUPPER SUPPER DRY and had a nasty freezer tastes to it like it was sitting in the back of the  freezer for month's maybe even a year. Now I know that the lau lau is not fresh and at some point it dose go into the freezer, that's fine. But to be cooking and selling something with freezer burn on it and hella dry is unacceptable. \n\nI called spoke to a lady that could only say \""it's good its good we cook all the time\"" over and over again \nlike she was program to only say thos words till finally Heather got back on to the phone a said sorry. I asked to speak to the manager and she would not let me. She had to hang up with me to speak to her manager Austin and call me back. She called back right away to inform me that there was nothing that could be done. I asked again if I would speak with this manager Austin and was denied. \n\nOver all. I spent $20 in food and had a bite then my bf throwed it away. No credit was offered of any type.\nSeems to me that they deal with a lot of complaints all the time and the business knows that there food is horrible and they will take whatever money they can get. Never will I come to this location again! \nI think the health district needs to give this places a visit.

Stopped in after buying a groupon.  Food is way overpriced.  I had a $20 groupon and only got two sandwiches (no sides), and two drinks.  I also splurged and got a piece of pecan pie.  Total rang up with me still owing $15 bucks. $35 bucks for two sandwiches and a piece of pie is a little ridiculous.   Food was ok.  It was hot and the restaurant area didn't have any air conditioning.  We sat out in the grassy picnic area which was nice but it was still hot.  Food was ok, but a little dry.

I used to buy La Prima espresso for my Pavoni all the time so I was pretty excited to actually get a cup of coffee here.  I ordered a cappuccino.  It tasted like milk and no coffee.  I was exceptionally disappointed.  So while the place has a great reputation,  even they can screw it up if they don't pay attention to detail, and  at this level they should never screw it up. I had a better cup at Martys Market for crying out loud!

The only reason this is not a 1-star review is because the food was actually good. The service, however, was terrible. We had a reservation for our large group of 12 but still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. The manager was rude and told us that a reservation was not a guarantee for seating. After we were finally seated, it took over an hour for our food to arrive. It's unfortunate that something as easy to provide as service was so blatantly ignored and that customers were treated as a burden. Get it together or you won't survive the Vegas local's service expectations.

I will save you the time and money, don't go.They have removed a large portion of the menu and the food is no longer good. Spent $40 bucks tonight as I have been a loyal customer since they opened and EVERYTHING is different. So bummed as this was my go to place, always knew it would be delicious! :( Calamari used to be large with a light and fluffy batter and now it was nothing but chunks of hard unflavored batter. Bit into a piece and couldn't even see the calamari. They have removed all the Lo Mein noodle dishes so I instead did a pad Thai which was a rice noodle, it came out all in one big sticky mass with no taste. Pot stickers were to die for and they no longer make those. Broccoli beef was thick and savory with tender beef, now it was swimming in a watery teriyaki type flavored \""sauce\"". The beef was tough and chewy. Egg fried rice was different as well. Got home, looked and tasted everything and pretty much threw away $40 worth of food. Bring back the old menu and cooks and I will consider returning. Until then I am taking my money, business and many many referrals of customers I have sent your way away from your business.  I have posted pictures of the food I bought this evening as proof.  Mine are the last 3 photos, you can tell the difference from mine and the older ones as far as quality. No more happy hour either. They have changed the name to Spice Asian Bistro as well. Shame the old owners had happy loyal customers and now the new ones are going to run a once amazing place out of business.

Yes, they're much greener than normal taxis. And yes, they're much easier to flag down at 3am than a black cab. But that's about a far as the list of plus points goes.\n\nThey cost about three times the price of a black cab, and even though there is a certain amount of wiggle room for haggling over the price, it will definitely end up costing you so much you'll probably wish you'd just walked it in the first place - 6 inch heels or not. \n\nThey're pretty much open-air too, despite their little flimsy roofs, so on those (many) Edinburgh nights when there's horizontal sleet falling when you come out of a club, you can expect a face-full of it all the way home. Which will take you three times as long as it would in a normal taxi, because the poor student who has to cycle the thing understandably doesn't have the same power in his legs as a car's engine.\n\nTheir one saving grace? They're great for that one person on any night out who always peaks far too early and needs to go home by midnight. And when I say \""peaks\"" I mean they've puked all over their own shoes and no black cabs will take them, and no-one's offering to walk them home. That's when these pedicabs are a welcome sight, but it's about the only time.

I asked for her to check and again was rudely spoken to being told I need to stop talking. She eventually checked where my spot was in the list and she realized she did in deed give our spot to the wrong person. Staff was disrespectful and could care less about their customers.

This place been here for years(guessing maybe 8yrs) so now they offer AYCE for $25.99. I love the tuna karai, something wrong #69, yellowtail was good also. Mussels were not what I expected, usually sushi places make it with baked mayonnaise drizzle eel sauce. They make it w/ponzu with scallions. Not my style. I asked for handroll yellowtail with oshinko(Japanese yellow pickle) and Chef said only what's on the menu. C'mon now....they had both on menu but just not together. What's the big deal? It's NOT like adding more fish, only a vegetable. Point deducted for service here. Asked for mochi(NOT included in AYCE), of course she doesn't mention this. It came out hard as a rock and just dug out the ice cream in the middle and ate that. She did take it off the bill.  I guess overall I like this place because of tuna karai.

Really really big let down.  Went here for the first time the other night.  We called ahead to ask if they had any happy hour specials going on that night for drinks and were told $2 sm beers, $4 lg, and $1 sake.  We showed up 30min later and ready to have a nice girls night out.  It started out with me being pretty disappointed with their AYCE menu...it seemed super limited all around.  Inside I think I was hoping that meant what they did have on the menu would be bomb.  Unfortunately that didn't rain true either.  Not one thing any of us ordered stood out as anything over \""average\"".  Service was TERRIBLE and there was maybe 3 groups total in there so no excuse on the extremely poor service.  I swear we'd order 2 rolls and wait 20min for them to come out every time.  One of my rolls was forgotten and I mentioned once that I hadn't received it still and then had to ask the waitress again 10min later where it was.  It was forgotten but apparently my first mention that I didn't have it wasn't enough for her to look into it.  We had to literally wave across the restaurant to get our server's attention whenever we'd like a drink or to order something else.  Oh...and about those drinks we had to work to get...we even confirmed pricing with the waitress before ordering asking \""happy hour prices for drinks right?\"" and she nodded.  Low and behold our bill came and everything was full price.  Normally I may have an experience at a restaurant where it's bad service, but amazing food.  Or food is mediocre, but the atmosphere is awesome.  This was honestly an all around terrible experience.  I personally wouldn't send anyone this way.

Meh.  I was very disappointed with this place.  I was looking forward to a good chicken fried steak and eggs, but the CFS was just awful. It was way too dry and overcooked.  The gravy was lacking seasoning, and the consistency was more of a sauce than a gravy.  Oh and throwing breakfast sausage 'meatballs' into the gravy does not make it real sausage gravy.... The redeeming items from our breakfast were the tater tots (cooked to a delightful crispy perfection) and the iced coffee (great balance of sweetness and the cardamom is a nice twist).  Seriously for the price, you're likely to find a better brekkie at Cracker Barrel.

Nice little Japanese restaurant that has awesome food and awesome sake. Been quite [[frequenting]] this place cause my gf and I love Japanese food. If ur in the mood for a Japanese food and want to avoid Ichiza type of [[ambiance]], this nice relaxed restaurant is the spot. Price is reasonable and the service is way above [[par]]. Miyuki is the manager and [[goes]] above and [[beyond]]. Open really late which is always good and their J's Sake Bar(next door) is always a hit if u wanna try many different [[flavors]] of sake

As I write this Im a student here with a couple months left before Im done. [[Dont]] [[come]] here. Im a Vet so I used my GI Bill meaning I didnt have to pay to come here for the welding program. Its about 20,000 to come take a 10 month course to learn 4 types of welding. Thats not good. You can go to the Maricopa Skill Center and learn the same thing for 10,000 and thats for a 17 month course. And good luck using your \""credits\"" anywhere else if you come here because its a for profit school. Do your research please. This was just the closest place to my house.

This place is a real time suck. When I walked in to finish opening my account the receptionist told me it would only be about 15 minutes. 35 minutes later, someone is finally available to help me finish opening an account. Unfortunately, the woman helping me seemed to have no idea what she was doing. I told her that I had started the membership application online and got to the last step when a message popped up saying something went wrong and I had to finish my application at a branch. She had to call three different people for help, and kept saying that I had skipped a step that I know I completed. What should have been a five minute stop turned into an hour. I am very disappointed in the service at this branch. These people have no idea what they are doing and are incompetent. If you have a lot of time to waste and enjoy dealing with clueless employees, you will love it here.\n\n[Edit: The icing on top of the cake- I told the representative who opened my account I wanted to order some checks. She said it would take about 2 weeks to come in the mail. 2 weeks later, still no checks. I call up UWCU and they said that checks hadn't been ordered for my account at all. Just another example of this branch's incompetency.]\n\n[Edit 2: After calling UWCU's customer service line, Jim was able to sort out the check issue and offered me the checks for free due to the mix up. I'm glad the rest of UWCU is not as bad as this branch.]\n\nOther things I do not like about UWCU: They charge a fee to transfer money to external accounts. I have accounts at two other credit unions that do not do that. Also, I still have not received my checks.

The tables are disgusting.  Nobody cleans them even though it is still early in the day.  For $10 I got two pieces of day old bread, a slice of cheese, a slice of tomato, and basil.  The workers don't speak English so it is very difficult to order.  Everything is overpriced.  They don't deserve to call themselves a restaurant when they take advantage of tourists who don't know any better.

I came to this place because its close to my home and I know someone that went here and her hair turned out nice so I tried it out. I initially wanted to get highlights and cut I showed the [[receptionist]] a picture and the hairstylist. I basically [[told]] her this is what I want. When I finally say down she explained to me the process before she started she offered me a \""great deal\"" includes hair treatments or conditioning with cut and color/highlights for $175. To be honest with you I have never paid that much to get my hair done. Anyways, she told me before she starts that I have to sign this paper to pretty much proves that I agree that I'm paying $175. So when she started she cut my hair first which turned out ok. Because I usually just get my trim before doing anything. Then after that she started showing me [[swatches]] on what she thought my hair would look nice in. I showed her the picture of how I want the color again and she [[kept]] on insisting on chili when The picture [[looks]] like blonde brown and light brown. I [[told]] her I want what [[I]] see in the picture.. After a long [[process]] of being in the dryer and washer I thought that the color is finally showing up because she showed a little bit if the strip of my hair. Long story short, nothing changed! I got the hair cut! She offered me products and I bought one! But the color stayed the same from when I came in. I love how she went step by step before she did my hair and she said in time it will slowly lighten but honesty I paid $200+ to make my hair look like something got done and it was such [[waste]]. I called the salon the next day because how upset I was. & i wanted to get my hair fixed..And the receptionist said that Sebastian is not in and my hair lady was off as well. And she was going to leave a note to let him know to call me back. So finally the next day came.. I called again Another receptionist answered and she said she thinks Sebastian might not be in today or if he is maybe later in today... Seriously I paid $200+ to get something done and the service is horrible. So for now that's my review on this place! I'll update you if Sebastian ever calls me.. 4/12/13. P.S I'm doing my review in my cellphone so there's some that's misspelled or typed incorrectly in sorry because I'm trying to get this review ASAP. Thanks!\n\n*** December 13, 2013*******\nOk, so it took me a while to get back on updating this review, So a week later I finally got a hold of Sebastian from Amnesia Salon, At first he mistaken me with another client with a black hair, and supposedly he told me himself that my hair won't turn out to be the way it is because my hair color is black. First of all.. I didn't even talk to this person at all. I saw him go in and out of the salon and that was it anyways, And My hair no black!! Long story short.  He told me to come in and they can fix my hair and he apologized with the situation because he realized that i wasn't that client that he supposedly talk too. When I came in, The hair stylist wasn't there  yet.. So i waited 15 mins. for her to get in. When she got it in... She has this Nasty attitude, like she didn't want to fix my hair. So i told her what I wanted and the color didn't show up. She still kept on insisting that it will fade over time. But no way im gonna wait a couple of weeks for my hair to fade and i paid 200+ to get my hair done! Get the hell out of here! Anyways, She finally started fixing my hair. She still had this nasty attitude towards me while she was fixing my hair but the hair was done and she fixed it. I love how the color turned out, it just like the picture that i showed her initially! I gave her another $20/tip .. mind you i gave her $20/tip the week before and i gave her another tip this visit.  I love how it turned out and i gave her my business card for work. I told her that I will call her in a few months to get a touch up. So that was for her to keep! Few days later... Sebastian started calling my work!! Like WTF!! It wasn't once.. it was about 5 times what my co workers told me at least. He said to call me back ASAP! What the hell... I gave the Hair stylist my business card for her to keep. So we can keep in touch for business... And sebastian starts calling my work like a maniac! None The less! The experienced with this Salon was supposed to turn around to a good review until Sebastian started to Call my work! How unprofessional! That is worst than a debt collector! NEVER AGAIN! Avoid this place! It is a bad attitude workers and unprofessional people and pricey at the same time!!

First off I'd like to start off with how AMAZING the food is. I can't complain about that. I honestly think they have the best menu in Vegas! It's my go-to spot for Sushi. They get 10 stars on the food! \n\nAs for the service, I don't know where to start. Don't get me wrong the servers are nice, never get an ugly attitude with them BUT they are so incompetent. Each and every single one of them. I'm not sure if they were trained that way but I get that experience with them every single time I come in. I feel like they forget to put my order and that's why they come by and ask what \""I'm waiting for..\"" It never fails! I am a server myself so I know how it can get sometimes... BUT it is so ridiculous that I get the same experience every time. I almost think that they're doing it to me on purpose, and I usually tip on 18-20% but this last time I just couldn't do it.  So the one star is for the service but the food is AAAAMAAZING!  \n\nIf you're willing to try delicious food on terrible service I'd suggest you try Oyshi.

This was my second visit to Brake Masters on Tropicana and it will be my last. I had purchased a card to get service and oil changes (3) for $35 from groupon for Brake Masters. On my first they changed the oil in my wife's Camry and gave me a long list of items they said needed attention one of them being that it needed a new air filter. I had just put one in 2000 miles before so I told them not today. \nWhen I got home I checked things out under the hood and they had left a bolt out of the filter housing and now it is lost.\nI thought oh well it was just an oversight and would try again with my Jeep. So I take it in and they do an oil change and filter and were supposed to lube it. They get it done in less than 30 minutes and I am on my way. I went to put the receipt away and notice on it that they used 5w-20 oil in it and so take it back. The manual says that grade of oil is only to be used if maximum temperature will be 60* . So the manager says ok we'll make it right and gets it on the rack they drain the oil and start to lower it down so I asked what about the filter it has 1/2 qt of wrong oil. So the guy asks the manager and he said ya go a head and change it again. So they change it and drain the new one and put it back in the box to be used on someone else's car also the oil they drained out they put in a clean pitcher and poured it back into the oil tank. Now all the oil is contaminated with the mixed oil from my jeep and the new oil.\nThen the manager tells me that the 5w20 is a better choice than the required 5w-30 that jeep recommends. This in my opinion is reason enough to not go back, until I climb und the jeep and find that they did not grease anything and also disconnected the breather for front differential at the pumpkin which if I was to go through any water would contaminate the oil.\nThe total lack of concern on what type of oil and lack of skill that they have at this business warrants not going there again. I hope this helps at least one other person. I you do go there please double check their work.

What can I say? Just not impressed. For all the hype I've heard about this place and numerous good reviews I was just disappointed. \n\nLet me start with the good. I went here for a friend's birthday dinner. My friend and I showed up early before the rest of our group. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks. Here's the good: our bartender was incredibly attentive and funny. My friend doesn't drink much so he gave her a hard time (but it was all in good fun). He was very inquisitive about our tastes in alcohol, and eventually he made me a very tasty cocktail which I enjoyed. He also made some shots for myself and my friend (didn't charge us, very nice of him!). I also asked him to make a drink that was \""purple\"". Based on the fact that my friend who was having the birthday's favorite color is indeed, purple. He obliged. So basically the two stars in this review is all for that particular bartender. Wish I remembered his name.\n\nLet's get on to the BAD. This place is supposed to be Americanized Tapas I guess. When we were sat for our party the waiter took awhile to come around. He took drink orders, but then took FOREVER to come back to take our food order. Also, there was a hub-bub about the all you can eat special. Some people at our table wanted to do the all you can eat, and some did not. The waiter refused to let us do that. RIDICULOUS. Just because my friend wants to do all-you-can-eat and I do not does not mean you should refuse someone. They acted like we were going to take off the plates of the other people who were having all-you-can-eat. We even explained that we were locals, and we felt it was kinda unfair treatment. We all ended up just ordering without the all you can eat.\n\nI had the fish tacos which were bland and boring. They came with shredded lettuce and a small bit of pico de gallo. Nothing else, not even a hot sauce or sour cream. I also had the PB&J which I felt was okay, but nothing to rave over. I think the best thing there was the bread they offered before we got our meals.\n\nIf you want tapas in Las Vegas go to Firefly. At lest you'll get REAL tapas with decent portions, and you won't be made to follow their silly rules, which I think are probably made up there because they know tourists will abide and probably just decide that everyone will do the AYCE, even if someone in the party doesn't want to.\n\nIf you're looking for good cocktails and you'd like to see a bit of a show (they do flare) than JS may be good, but go somewhere else for tapas!! You will be happy you did.

As for  CD's and DVD's since you are already at the mall I would recommend going somewhere else as they are far over priced at any Borders.\n\nThe only thing I would rave about is the magazine selection.

I enjoyed the Arizona Ultimate Women's Expo.  It was something that of course was geared towards women, but I saw several men there as well.  I must have entered at least 15 drawings.  Deidre Hall was great.  It's an even better time if you can get a few girlfriends to go with you.  There were 4 different stations for alcohol samples.  Some of them were good some not so much, like the Senorita Limonita.  That was horrible.  If anyone plans on going in the future, plan ahead.  I totally didn't even think about the Diamondbacks playing.  I had to drive a little bit further for parking, which was [[worth]] it.  It only cost me $5, whereas every other lot or garage I saw, was $15 or $20.  Also, take your time when walking through the expo.  There's so much to see and do.  Find out when the keynote speakers go on and when demos are, so that you can get the most out of it.

I came here to cure a hangover. To cure a hangover in Hawaii, I would eat pho or dim sum so I came here in search of some great dim sum. Well, you're definitely not going to find it here. The dim sum came in metal steamers which I thought was odd. I've only seen wooden ones before. I soon found out why most places use wooden ones... Because the dim sum sticks to the metal ones, causing all the fillings to come out of the unwrapped dumpling!\n\nI ordered the wonton soup... The soup was so bland that I may have been drinking hot water and I wouldn't have known the difference. \n\nOur table shared some other \""traditional\"" Chinese dishes and they all sucked. To top everything off, the service was one of the worst. He never refilled our water, never came by to check on us so we couldn't let him know how awful the food was and he took forever to bring out the check. \n\nThe reason we chose this place? I overheard two separate strangers that Chin Chin had great Chinese food. They serve sushi here too. What kind of Chinese restaurant serves sushi? This kind! The sucky kind!

I just brought my 3 year old son here last week and what a treat it turned out to be. He loved it! The displays were so releastic, educational, and fun. I mean my son just turned 3 and is not quite reading and still came out of there with a lot of new knowledge. He is also really into dinasours, so the dinasour room thrilled him. He also really enjoyed all the live animals they had, shark, sting ray, fish, turtle, lots of bugs, snakes, bearded dragon, etc. He had a blast and I know as he gets older he is going to love it more and more. As an adult I also really enjoyed it and learned many new things.

Yes, as someone stated before, this place makes hooters look like a classy restaurant. You walk in, and the nurse tells you to sit wherever you want at this enormous awkwardly shaped table (a cross). I'm sure the owner or whoever designed it thought it was brilliant, but it was really awkward seating for our 6 person group. You sit on the outside of the cross, and the \""nurses\"" work on the inside, taking orders/serving, etc. The inner lining of the cross also has mirrors, so you can check out your ugly nurses' asses from a variety of unflattering angles. And you end up staring and being stared at by other patrons of the restaurant, since you have to sit facing them.\n\nThe food is really disappointing. Seriously, you expect the food at HAG to be like a \""guilty pleasure,\"" but for being that unhealthy, it has no flavor. Apparently, all they really intend is to clog your arteries, not to feed you something delicious. You can't justify putting that food in your mouth, because it tastes like soggy mush. Each patty is a half pound of unseasoned beef, cheese is optional. You have to go up and get your own tomatoes/onions/pickles (no lettuce), and also your own fries (which they charge extra for, and only put out in small batches, so you have to wait in line to get them since they run out so quickly). The fries, yes you would expect them to be delicious for being fried in lard, but no, they are soggy and gross. It was basically eating some disgusting potato and ketchup casserole. Oh, and all beverages come in a bottle, including water, which is another way for this cheap restaurant to charge you. \n\nOur \""nurse\"" (i.e. waitress) was also 40+ years old, and should not have been wearing that skimpy outfit, and the other nurse was too fat for her job. I guess they make the ugly nurses work during weekdays (jk..not really). The service was terrible too. Seriously, there was barely anyone there, and the nurses acted like they were busy doing something, and never tended to us or followed up with us. Like dumbas$es we still paid tip.\n\nAnyway, go to hooters if you want better tasting food, better service, and better looking waitresses. I'm sure it's equally unhealthy, so don't feel bad. If you want burgers however, Red Robin has a tasty selection,, and their fries are absolutely delicious (and they bring them to you, so you're not standing in line like an a$$). Come to think of it, I think HAG stole their menu from In-N-Out. The burgers are the same, just bigger and flavorless. At In N Out, you can order a hamburger, a cheeseburger, a double-double, and then the \""secret menu\"" of increasing cheeseburger sizes, and  which is exactly what HAG does. \n\nBasically, the way HAG runs its restaurant is to cut corners. Make you serve yourself, while still bringing your food to you to collect tip. The huge table is easy to service, cuz hey, it's just one huge table. You're not really engaged in what is supposed to be an amazing and awesomely unhealthy experience to remember. Nothing is fun about being at HAG. They don't live up to the theme of the restaurant than say, 5&Diner where you get the feel that you're in a 50s diner. Oh, and the music sucks.\n\nBottom line, go to this restaurant if you want to clog your arteries. That's all you'll get out of your experience. That and regret.

My family [[wanted]] to eat a [[good]] and cheap Christmas dinner as we were going to hit the buffets the next day. Known for the prime rib and steak and egg specials, Victorian Cafe was our destination that cold Christmas night. We got there around 9:30 PM and although there were a few empty tables, we were seated about ten minutes after we got there. Something about having to wait for the waitress to seat us. \n\nAnyway, I scanned the Yelp reviews on what was good, and decided to go with their prime rib special, which is usually $12.99 but on that day, was raised to $13.99. Too bad the steak and egg special is valid only after 11 PM. Each prime rib special comes with a salad or soup and fries, mashed potatoes or a baked potato. And of course, the table gets a basket full of hot rolls and butter. \n\nThe salad and rolls were delicious, but we all [[wanted]] to save our appetites for the prime rib. (We all ordered the same thing, haha). The prime rib comes out a while later, which made us all think that ... man, they must have run out of prime rib, so they're cooking us some good fresh one! When it arrived, each one was pretty darn big. Mine was a little bigger than the size of my hand! [[Unfortunately]], the prime rib [[tasted]] really [[weird]]. It didn't even taste like meat! I felt like I was chewing on some weird variation of prime rib (almost like a vegetarian prime rib). It tasted like an imitation, and not at all like how prime rib usually tastes. Needless to say, my family and I were all very [[disappointed]]. We had to force the prime rib down, and this was the first time we actually had food left on our plates that we did not take back in a to-go box. \n\nGood service, good salad and bread, but sucky prime rib! The crust was too salty and the meat was too rubber tasting. We were confused as the meat was pink - not overcooked, but just not [[tasting]] the way it should. The ambiance was nice with dim lighting and booth seating (tables as well), but that prime rib was a shame.

[[I]] recently stayed here for 3 [[nights]]. The room was quite large with a king bed and a sitting area with a fold out couch and a table with chairs. Large TV. Very large bathroom with 2 sinks and a separate toilet/shower area.  There was even a phone in there!  Small [[refrigerator]], nice sized closet. View overlooking the golf course. Bed was a little [[firm]] for my taste. The room was very nice and clean. Very quiet in the rooms, even at night.  Workout facility is clean. Casino has nice updated machines. Parking in the garage is [[easy]]. Even went to the movies, was surprised that the movie ticket price was comparable to other theaters.

The lines at Tacos El Gordo were too long so we decided to just eat at this Denny's. Bad choice. It was New Year's Day but the place was dead. Only one other table of customers besides us. A guy came to our table and took our drink and food order and never returned. We went 35 minutes with no drinks or acknowledgement. The manager had time to clean a window partition yet couldn't find the time to get us our drinks or even just acknowledge us. We were sat in the far corner so I couldn't see the kitchen but the manager seated us and the guy cooking took our order so they knew we were there. Finally I decided we would leave and go to a different location. I walked over to the kitchen to tell the manager we were leaving. She said \""oh wait I'll cook your food right now\"" and I told her to forget it. I mean they were only going to start cooking our food because I said we were leaving. She never once said sorry or showed any type of sympathy to the situation they put us in. She  had no issue with us leaving and could have cared less.

The Mansions on Fifth is a beautiful venue to have your wedding!!  This is a family operated business and from day one I was showered with personal attention. The owners are very much involved in the day to day and were extremely accommodating, attentive and motivated to ensure every detail of my wedding was perfect.  Jennifer Pendleton (the event sales coordinator) and her team are truly the best! Jennifer definitely made the wedding planning process stress free and smooth sailing! I am so blessed to have hired her as a wedding planner and pulling off our special day. Everything was beautiful and flowed seamlessly. My guests NEVER wanted for anything during their stay.  We received so many compliments on our wedding and it was all because Jennifer and her team pulled everything together perfectly.  She knows what she is doing! If I had to rate my experience at the Mansions on Fifth from 1 to 10...it would be a 20! Whenever we needed something or had a question, Jennifer and her team were always responsive and quick! She was always professional, creative, and got the job done!  She understood our vision and it turned out beautifully! Thank you so much again and I highly recommend the Mansions on Fifth Hotel to any engaged couple!

My experience here was a mixed [[bag]].   We went in around 7:45 on a Friday evening without a reservation and were able to get seated before the bartender even had a chance to finish making my white grapefruit martini which was very refreshing.\n\nFor dinner, I opted to start with the spring salad minus the pig ear bacon.   This was FABULOUS!!!  I would have ordered a second one if it wasn't $10.  I followed this up with the Tagliatelle Pasta (tomatoes, garlic and squash, oh my) which could have been amazing but was only so-so because I was served the most undercooked pasta ever.   The flavors in the dish were awesome.  I wanted to lick the plate but it was hard to get past the chewy pappardelle noodles (not tagliatelle) which were 2 minutes short of al dente.   I did mention this to the waiter who passed along the info to the chef which I appreciated (witnessed it since the kitchen is so open).\n\nWe passed on a dessert which is a rarity because they just didn't have many options and the ones they did weren't up our alley.   I was craving cheesecake or some kind of fall dessert (maybe an apple turnover).\n\nNow here's the weird part.  When the bill came, there were only three items on the menu (my dinner wasn't listed).  I thought my pasta had been comped because it was so undercooked but then I realized the items in the bill totaled $16 less than the total bill  (ie something was in the total that wasn't in the itemized listing).  It just so happened to be my pasta.  When I pointed it out the waiter, he just said it was an error in the system.  Perhaps I'm reading into it, but I just thought it was shady that I was paying for it but it wasn't appearing on the bill.   I don't know; must be the accountant in me.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is pleasant and the service was so-so.  The waiter was a little inattentive given how few tables were filled.   Overall though, I was pretty pleased.   I really loved their use of flavors so I was more than willing to pay the higher-end prices but I was disappointed in my undercooked pasta.

[[They]] ruined our neighborhood Pei Wei.  We used to do PW once-a-week.  Loved the food and everything else about the place.  Unique flavors that we couldn't find anywhere else.  We finally went last night after the new \""Market\""  opened.  [[I]] like the idea of the smaller portions. I can even deal with the new limited menu... But what used to be fresh food, wok-seared and served extremely hot is now pre-made and warmed up then plopped into a plastic dish.  Then you get to find your own plastic utensil to eat with.  The people that used to work there that we saw on a regular basis are now different employees, and with no customer service (bordering on rude).  The new seating is uncomfortable, and the ambiance is non existent.  We will [[never]] go back.  For 30 cents more, and a drive over to 44th & Thomas, we can get twice as much food, that is served well (and HOT)  by people who act like they care if we are happy eating there.  \n\nI understand this is a pilot restaurant to compete with the fast food joints.

Food is good. \n\nHowever, service is nice but slow. I waited for my dessert for 30 minutes. The cookie was over cooked and so hard it couldnt even be cut with a fork. The cookie was cold and not warm like its supposed to be, and could tell it had been sitting in the kitchen ready to be delivered to our table because the ice cream was so melted it covered the whole of the cookie. \n\nOur last experience wasnt any better. Luckily, the manager came out in our last visit when he noticed our food looked bad just as it was being delivered! He's the only reason this place got an extra star.

[[Meh]]. I've [[experienced]] [[better]].\n\nGood and cheap Mexican food absolutely must be inclusive in order to work.  Here it's just barely.  Saying that, I still decided to go more than once.\n\nFirst go was on a weekend when they make Menudo.  This is a dish that will usually either scare me from future visits or endear the place to me.  For the first time ever: all I could say about it was, \""[[meh]].\""  Apparently there is a variation of Menudo that's neither great nor horrible.  The tripe was tender and for the most part trimmed well.  The broth was definitely lacking some flavor, but not that a few additions didn't remedy it sufficiently.  My biggest issue was that probably a good third of my order was taken up by one of their stewing bones that just happened to get scooped in there.  It can happen, but this one was too big to be entirely negligence.\n\nSecond go involved two tacos.  I like to pit a place's carnitas versus adobada to see which one I prefer of theirs.  For the record, their adobada won this battle.  Really, in my experience, I haven't seen many places with the skill to screw up either of these.  Both were quite tastey, but the portions I'm used to were slightly lacking.  I guess I've been spoiled by places that have made me wonder if there was a tortilla under there.  They didn't just skimp on the meat though, but also the toppings.  Just a smidge of pico de gallo and a dollop of guacamole that wouldn't take me too much convincing that they bought from a supermarket.  Still I will point out that both the carnitas and adobada were well prepared and full of the right flavors.\n\nA special note will go to their pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos.  It's pretty difficult for a condiment to catch my attention, and truth be told, I almost missed out.  On my first visit, someone, noticing my initial indecisiveness on the menu, deduced that I had never tried them and recommended them heartily.  The fact that they provide sandwich bags to be able to take some home means that it's no secret the stuff is good.  Cooked just to the right amount to have both some caramelization and crunch.  Spiced and pickled to be tangy without an overbearing heat.\n\nAn all latino and friendly staff -- which is a must in my book.  English isn't the best, and something tells me even a little Spanish will get you a tad better service.  Either way, it's all pretty decent.

They didn't just skimp on the meat though, but also the toppings.  Just a smidge of pico de gallo and a dollop of guacamole that wouldn't take me too much convincing that they bought from a supermarket.  Still I will point out that both the carnitas and adobada were well prepared and full of the right flavors.\n\nA special note will go to their pickled carrots, onions, and jalapenos.  It's pretty difficult for a condiment to catch my attention, and truth be told, I almost missed out.  On my first visit, someone, noticing my initial indecisiveness on the menu, deduced that I had never tried them and recommended them heartily.  The fact that they provide sandwich bags to be able to take some home means that it's no secret the stuff is good.  Cooked just to the right amount to have both some caramelization and crunch.  Spiced and pickled to be tangy without an overbearing heat.\n\nAn all latino and friendly staff -- which is a must in my book.  English isn't the best, and something tells me even a little Spanish will get you a tad better service.  Either way, it's all pretty decent.

Hubby and I wanted a nice Mexican meal after a ceremony. Decided to give this new restaurant a try. We've had our fair share of experiences in the Mexican Food field; from Mundo, to others in Las Vegas, Mexico, South America & even Australia. The prices are high but not that bad. Food wasn't [[worth]] the money though. Guacamole was [[ordinary]] and my mom's enchiladas taste much better than the ones I had there. I won't be visiting again. Disappointed.

Let me preface this review with a couple of things:\n1. I went on a Monday at 3pm, so probably not the most ideal time to see the freshest foods and most attentive staff, but less people to fight with to get to the food\n2. I [[live]] in Manhattan so I am [[spoiled]] by knowing what good food and service are\n3. I understand that a buffet, even an expensive buffet will never meet the quality of a decent restaurant\n\nWith all that said, the variety and quality of food was JUST BARELY OK, after seeing several reviews I guess my expectations got a little too high.\n\nAlso of note I found a HAIR in my gravy, when I mentioned it to the waitress her extremely caviler response was some thing to the effect of \""OK, I let them know\"".  No \""I'm so [[sorry]]\"" or \""I really apologize\"", NOTHING.\n\nAll in all not a great experience, but if you want a large quantity of [[food]] you can't beat it for 20 bucks

We did not buy that deal, we were regular customers...\n\nOk, starting at the beginning.  \n\n- Check-in is 4:00pm.  We got there at 3:50pm, arrived to a line of no less than 30 people.  NO rooms were available for us.  They temporarily checked us in and said we could go to the water park and call back in an hour to see if a room was ready... but, the only place to change was at the Athletic Club clear on the opposite side of the park.  By the time we hiked over there and back it was 5pm.  Our room wasn't ready until 6:40 (we called about 5 times until they finally had one ready.)  \n\n- The room was HOT.  It was on the top floor and really never cooled down, even after we removed a gross, dirty air filter (I'll be posting a picture in case you're into looking at icky stuff.)  If you're one of those people who likes it very quiet to sleep, top floor is bad.\n\n- Also, on the noise topic, our bathtub dripped so bad it sounded like the faucet was on a slow trickle the whole time.  Water wasters!  Side note, the bathroom was so small you had to step out of the way to shut the door.  A large person might need to step into the tub to shut the door. :(\n\n- Gross... there were several places of STICKY on the carpeting.  2 were right in places where normal people put their feet all the time so that was annoying and nobody should have been in that room until that was cleaned (but they were completely sold out because of the LivingSocial.[[com]] deal.)\n\n- [[The]] railings [[along]] the walkways to our [[room]] [[seem]] 'flimsy' to an acrophobe like me.

And any time you get a bunch of people staying at a resort they wouldn't normally be able to afford, you're going to get a class of people that are... sub-par.  We saw at least 2 instances of people just taking other peoples chaises, even when they clearly had their personal stuff (shoes, shirts) stored there.  There was considerable pushing and shoving to get in the water, lots of unsupervised, rude 8-12 year old kids.  All of this was a nuisance that probably is not a regular issue.\n\n\n\nTHE HOTEL DID TRY TO MAKE RIGHT BY US.  We only complained about having to wait for a room for so long and they ended up cutting our hotel rate in half (which was then less than those LivingSocial.com folks) and giving us vouchers for drinks (6) and enough vouchers to cover our lunch (for 6 people.)  So they were aware of how screwed up things were.  We didn't complain about the room or the park as it was so incredibly busy it didn't seem worth it.

I was, prior to visiting, a little disappointed that I never got a chance to visit D'Arcy McGee's before it was replaced by Bar Louie. After hearing from my employer and his brother-in-law that it was not such a great place, that disappointment faded.\n\nI decided to visit Bar Louie in early November while I was at Tempe Marketplace to watch a movie. I walked through the front door and was not greeted by either a hostess or any other employee. I traipsed toward the bar and was also not greeted by either of the two bartenders behind the bar. I continued forward and finally found a nice young lady whom I asked about seating. She retrieved a server and I requested to be sat on the patio. The patio was empty and I chose a corner table. My waiter informed me that he would be right back and would bring me a menu.\n\nAfter bringing a menu back, I inquired as to whether or not there were any beer specials ongoing. I was dismayed to find out that their refrigeration system was on the fritz and they only had three beers available: New Castle Brown Ale and two run-of-the-mill, piss-poor domestics. I chose the New Castle.\n\nAfter receiving my drink, I ordered from their very straightforward menu after asking the server what his personal favorite menu item was.

Everything tasted fresh and it looked well-constructed.\n\nMy only [[complaint]] was the portion size.

Regardless, the service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable, the food was quite good and the atmosphere (at least from where I was sitting; on the outside looking in) seemed warm.\n\nAll-in-all, I can recommend it to others, but I can't say that it is a five-star establishment.

Fuck this place.\n\nYes, I said it and even after 6 years, I will still [[say]] it.\n\nSo the girls and I are on a tear it up Vegas weekend. All very cute and sessy gals for the record and all gals who appreciate the less than finer things in life like fake boobied strippers, over-priced drinks and titty bars. \n\nSo we cab it over to the Crazy Horse Too after hearing that THIS was THE place to go. We roll up and instantly get static at the door. You can't come in without a date. Um, okay, well we are a bunch of girls with lots of money to spend? NO! But...? NO!\n\nSo we walk a few feet away and regroup while trying to keep the temper of one Drunky MaGoo down to a manageable level since the a-hole of a door guy was especially [[rude]] to this one girl in our group. I suggest grabbing a few guys and rollin in with them. I mean who cares, we can ditch them at the door but at least it gets us in. So we latch onto said guys and walk up.\n\nDoor guy says, NO!\n\nI say, \""You said dates, these are our dates. We are in love, let us in.\"" (Mind you I'm drunk and his anger is amusing me at this point)\n\nDoor guy says, \""fine you can come in, but that one stays out!\"" (pointing to my friend)\n\nI say, \""Come on, don't be THAT guy, did mama raise you to be THAT guy? She just really wants to see some boobs, surely you can relate.\""\n\nApparently he couldn't, but I also think he was suffering from mama abandonment issues and clearly wasn't loved enough as a child, but I digress...\n\nHe then decides that none of us should be allowed to come in. Fine, I'd rather not go if my friend is going to not be let in, so just give us our money back and we will go spend it elsewhere, right?\n\nApparently this is when the poor chap lost all sense of hearing as i became invisible and mute in his eyes.\n\n\""Excuse me, I said we'll go. Can you please just give us our money back?\""\n\n\""Hello?\""\n\n\""Umm\""\n\n\""Yo!\""\n\nRetard Roy then starts smirking and it is quite clear that the four of us who \""got in\"" will not be getting our money back, even though we technically never even entered the club. \n\nI then followed up with calls to the establishment the next day that were (to no surprise) never returned. Maybe they are in cahoots with Prime Time Shuttle as their customer service seems to be pretty dead on.\n\nSo if you are a girl don't go here. If you are a guy, have at it, but why waste your money on a place that won't let cute girls in who might actually go home with you for free. Just sayin.

O-M-G! I must've died and gone to [[heaven]]! This place was absolutely [[spectacular]]! I admit it took about 20 mins to get but the line moved pretty fast and I was drunk so I wasn't complaining. This place had some of EVERYTHING. I couldnt make it to dessert because I had filled up on everything else. They had things like duck, pizza, wings, Chinese food,  CRAB LEGS, and about a thousand other things. Everything seemed so clean and the staff were also very friendly.

So I came here with a bunch of friends as our first group meal for a bachelor party weekend on a Friday night. We were all starving to be honest and this place had been set up as our go to stop. We received a number of pre-ordered dishes family style that were already included in our costs so I am not sure what the breakdown was, but it was AYCE and we definitely enjoyed the grub.\n\nWe had about 30 guys and took over a gigantic table next to a bachelorette and her party and a bunch of normal patrons. We had multiple courses and the food came out hot and tasty and in portions big enough for our entire table to get enough to eat at once...\n\nPro Tip: Call ahead and get a reservation. A number of people had to wait quite a while in order to get seated who didnt.\n\nThe food was all decent to tasty and the chicken and pasta dish stuck out as the best to me. It had some type of a white (creme?) sauce with it. The dinner also included appetizers and dessert. It's a tremendous amount of food and the only way to go if you dont want to hit up the buffet's.  \n\nThe one thing I will add is that the service is not exactly the best. It took several requests before anyone brought us water or drink refills (soda, tea, beer, etc). It was also a bit difficult to get additional bread n butter. It just seemed to take an inexorably long time.\n\nOverall it was [[worth]] it and our service could have been affect by the sheer size of our group. It is hard to say for sure.

A bit of a run down hotel in a location convenient to CMU. Everything is clean and functional, but really doesn't stray far from functional.\n\nIt also has a few oddities. The bathrooms have full-length mirrors that face the toilet. The net connection is slow enough that it's not great for doing business (e.g., VPN). My wireless modem is as fast or faster. Service was kind of perfunctory and cool. Not a bad thing, but not something to recommend either.\n\nRooms are large. Beds tend toward the soft end of the spectrum.

And a pizookie!!\n\nYes, the wait is around 45 minutes every day of the week, but most of the time they will let you put in a deep dish pizza order while you are waiting.   Love it!

I hate this place. We asked them if they would comp the drinks if we played the bar machines. They said you had to put at least $10 in, which is fair enough. I then tried to order Three Olives cake vodka with diet coke, and apparently they can only comp the garbage Smirnoff or Absolut. Are you kidding me?? They shoud be happy that anyone is even coming into this s**thole.

Eggstasy restaurant is finally open! Had a nice, BIG, breakfast there this morning, just to be sure.  The hash browns are the best, nice mix of crunch and generous seasoning for excellent flavor. The Benedict with crispy prosciutto was recommended by my server and was a great selection, prosciutto was thinly sliced and cooked up like bacon, only crispier, and smokier. The [[poached]] egg (just the very teensiest, slightest bit underdone) and hollandaise (very lemony, yum!), over a monster of an English muffin from a local bakery. Portions were HUGE - half of my Bene and most of the hash browns are in the fridge for tomorrow. Service was excellent!

This place is horrible. I will never stay here again. The customer service is soooooo bad. I flew in from California and they gave my reservation away saying \""reservations are not guaranteed.\"" Elevators hardly work. They deactivated my room key everyday. Housekeeping knocks on your door everyday at 9am to remind them of checkout even if they are not checking out. Security got caught on camera taking a football game break IN my hotel room, not realizing someone had checked into it.The decor is very nice, but thats the only nice thing about this place. Their credit card swipes are so janky that it never works properly. Worst hotel experience Ive ever had.

I've eaten at the Ikea cafeteria several times, and while the food won't blow your mind, they have a good selection of hot buffet items (including the coveted Swedish meatballs with creamy gravy) as well as cold sandwich and salad plates. Another nice touch is that you can always find something with salmon in it. And although I'm not a sweet drink fan (I'm always searching for extra diet soda options), whenever I'm at the soda fountain here I help myself to an icy glass of lingonberry juice drink. Hey when in Sweden... er, Ikea, do as the other random [[shoppers]] do... or something to that effect.\n\nWhat I do want to mention that may be overlooked in other reviews of the Ikea cafeteria, is that they periodically have special dining events. I discovered on the [[Ikea]] website that they announce an all-you-can-eat Swedish Crayfish Party. Unfortunately, you cannot buy the tickets on-line, so you have to show up in person at the Ikea cafeteria. My delinquency in getting myself over there in the past stymied my chance at checking this event out years ago. This time I was determined to get my crack at some tasty mudbugs (having lived in Louisiana for seven years, I am a bit obsessed with getting my seasonal crawfish fix). I bought my tickets about a week in advance, and the second seating (6 - 8 p.m.) was already [[sold]] out. I settled on the first seating from 3 - 5 p.m. Note that this event takes place during a weekday, so not [[everybody]] has an accommodating work schedule for the early seating.\n\nThe Crayfish Buffet was quite [[impressive]]! The [[crawfish]] are served cold and aren't cayenne pepper spicy, like Cajun style. Rather, they have a distinctive dill seasoning that is interesting nonetheless. The rest of the buffet includes a mess of food including Swedish meatballs, pickeled herring, smoked salmon, salt-cured lox, cold salads, potatoes (boiled and mashed), cheese and crispbread, shrimp cocktail, and a great dessert selection of rhubarb tarts, elderflower cupcakes and cookies! You will not go home [[hungry]] after sampling everything.\n\nThe food service personnel were [[super]] [[friendly]] and [[helpful]]. The entire cafeteria [[area]] was closed to regular shoppers and reserved for the big party. The entire place was decked out with crayfish-themed decorations including bibs and party hats! We made new friends while waiting in line and dined and chatted the entire time. If you are a crawfish fan, or just an avid food explorer who wants to sample a little bit of Sweden, keep your eyes peeled for these occasional funky events at the Ikea cafeteria. What a blast!

Place looked great but since we never tried their food we were not sure what to expect. And then...What an amazing surprise...\n\nThe food was absolutely amazing. I had tomato basil soup, which was amazing. Then for the main course I ordered Baby Octopus that was served with mashed potatoes, old bay aioli and breadcrumbs. It was out of this world. The portion was really small but you do not want plate of entire octopus on it...just saying. \n\nMy boyfriend had Mushroom pizza with house made sausage, garlic and thyme. He was as well blown away. I had to have a piece because it looked so good and I didn't want him to eat entire pizza by him self . The crust was awesome. It was tender but yet crispy throughout.  It was full of flavors. I had to pick sausages out as I do not eat pork but he said they were the bomb. \n\nDrinks were to die for as well. We had Ways&Means (bourbon, sweet vermouth, 2 bitters, maple) and High Tide (gin, orange, lime, mint). They were very different from each other but flavors were amazing on both. \n\nService was just out of this world as well. Our server was really helpful by explaining the Menu, checking on us in timely manner and getting us exactly what we needed when we needed it. \n\nThis is a kind of a place that I will keep going back to.

We finally got a chance to try this place Friday and loved it. The ambiance and design of the place is wonderful. The staff is super friendly and most are very good looking. We ordered a bunch of different appetizers including their nachos, quesadillas, fried calamari, and queso dip. Everything was good, not stellar, but tasted pretty good. The fried calamari wasn't crispy enough for my liking. I left full and happy though, which is all that really matters. We also ordered their sangria, because everyone had talked about it. They have four different flavors. Their passion fruit one is by far the best, a couple of those and you will have a great buzz going on. In general I really enjoyed my experience here, and will definitely be going back for their delicious sangria!

If you're looking for a 4 hour oil change this is the spot! Completely. Useless. Got there at noon for an oil change in our SUV, they didn't seem busy and the guy at the front was nice and helpful. We were quoted 30-45 min so decided to wait. 45 min later we got up to check on it - hadn't even started. We were then told that an employee called in so they were a bit behind, fine, I get that it happens. Communicate that though. Against my husband's better judgment we decided to wait it out and were told it'd be 45 min. We chose to take our other car to run some errands and were surprised over 2 hours later to get the call it was done. No discount. No coupon for future service. Nada.

Harvest is an [[excellent]] restaurant on the main square in downtown Madison. Their food incorporates local seasonal ingredients. I had a special salad of local heirloom tomatoes with a soft cheese (forgot the name), small leaves of basil and sea salt. Some of the [[best]] tomatoes I've had in years. I selected the home-made cavatelli pasta - made with [[pesto]]. sliced baby potatoes and green beans. Very [[good]] - and finished with a [[passion]] fruit sorbet. Highly recommended!

[[I]] can't seem to fathom what the employees are thinking at this place. They show no hospitality at all, and basic restaurant service seems to be non-existent. They work as if they're offended to be our waiters and waitresses.\n\nAs my party and I are seated, the server asks us if we are ready to order.  We need some time to look at the menu, so we tell him to give us some time.  Only thirty seconds pass when he returns and asks us to order.  We repeat the procedure about 2 more times until we feel so compelled to order we give in.  My dad had a special request to add chicken and beef in the soup, but the server couldn't understand us. He seemed really confused and frustrated, so he brought someone else over who had better English. He turned around and muttered some word that I'm sure wasn't too polite.\n\nWe place our order and in less than five minutes our dishes are ready.  I love fast service, but for some reason I felt queasy that day.  I just knew it wasn't prepared 100% fresh.

The check-in was horrible. We waited 45 min only to see that the room was nothing like we booked. We asked for a non-smoking room with a king size bed, got a smoking room with two queen size beds! They said they will change it at 3 pm today which does not help because we are here for two nights only. So thanks for ruining the first one.

I like American Eagle's jeans.  I, however, do NOT like this AE location.\n\nI always feel like I'm inconveniencing the sales associates by asking to try something on.  When I ask for a fitting room, I'm greeted with eye-rolling and huffing.  I'm sorry you're busy.  That's what having a job entails - actually doing work.  And the reason you have a job is because I shop at AE.  So you can get me a fitting room when I ask nicely.  Once, I actually had a female salesperson tell me that, no, she's too busy to get me a fitting room.  Really?!  If that's someone else's job, direct me to that person.  Don't just say no and turn your back to me.  That's so rude.

This review is not a hamburger review.  Been there twice and ordered sandwiches both times.\n\nI was very impressed with the friendly service, even after we were seated-as this place is not a wait-service style restaurant.  Food was quick and very fresh.  Once I ordered the Tri-Tip Sandwich on grilled sourdough.  It was excellent!  Tender, flavorful meat.  Second time I ordered the Chicken Club. Nothing spectacular but it was done well.  Sad to say the sweet potato fries were a major disappointment.  Literally zero flavor.  The onion rings were tasty, though.\n\nNo, this place does not replace In-n-Out and doesn't even compare in my opinion.  [[But]] still a great place to go if you want something fresh and new.

I hate writing bad reviews but this seriously warrants it.  Maybe other Lowes are better but this particular store just fails.  Management hides behind their employees and don't own up to their mistakes of which with my delivery there were multiple.  They forgot our delivery and while I waited all day no one from Lowes call about it.  Then after I called, they said they forgot to load my units on the truck and they rescheduled my delivery.  When they did show up the units they were going to deliver were damaged and undeliverable.  They delivery guys said they'd get us new units that day or the next.  After waiting 24 hrs for a call from Lowes, I called and was told it won't be in till Wednesday.  Well I wasted another day waiting around for a delivery that didn't come.  Absolutely no management took responsibility for the mistakes, it was all 'this wasn't my mistake' or 'I'm just finding out about this'. Absolutely no one was going to call me it seems instead they were find just taking my money. I know its a hardware store but seriously when someone gives you money principle dictates you give them their purchase.

[[Hands]] down, the [[best]] gourmet popcorn anywhere.  I don't know how much heroin they put in each batch, but I literally could not [[stop]] eating this stuff.  I bought two small bags--about a quart and a half each--and they were both gone within three days.  Disgusting (me) and transcendent (the popcorn).  \n\nIt's a cool sort of cute-industrial aesthetic they have, with white-painted crumbling brick walls, huge stainless steel vats, and of course the old-fashioned popcorn cart which displays most of the varieties.  It reminds me a lot of a fudge shop on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.  The teenage staff could deploy a few more smiles, but ultimately, it's all about the product.\n\nThey sell a couple of savory and several sweet varieties, plus kettle corn which falls nicely in between.  Flavors-of-the-week last week were hazelnut nutella and zesty ranch, both good; but I went with Cinnamon Toast and Chocolate Caramel.  They sell the stuff in paper bags, plastic jugs, or handsome tins.  They also offer coffee, soda, and fresh-squeezed lemonade.\n\nThey have a website with online ordering, so now that they've got me [[hooked]], they will [[definitely]] be [[hearing]] from me again.  It makes a [[great]] gift, and by the way, my birthday is coming up and Christmas is always right around the corner.

Still in search of a good breakfast place in Scottsdale, and the Breakfast Joynt left a lot to be desired. First the service was slow but friendly, and because I pay the bill I appreciated the $1.95 for the large glass of chocolate milk for my son and good size cup of hot chocolate for my daughter. As far as my meal the corned beef beef hash was OK nothing special, the hash browns went from burnt on the edges to barely cooked in the middle, sausage gravy and biscuits were good but would of been a lot better had they been served hot. Everything else was just OK. Don't order the \""Almost World Famous Apple Pancakes\"" don't even call ahead (as they suggest) we ordered them knowing that they would take 30 minutes to prepare, so we all ate breakfast and sampled them after our meal. It's just a big bowl of cooked custard with apples. absolutely NO flavor. Don't waste the time or your money.

[[Having]] eaten my way through most of the AYCE sushi places in Vegas, I can [[say]] that some definitely shine bright (more creative rolls, better fish selection, etc), but Sushi-mon [[wins]] every [[time]] in [[overall]] value, consistency and freshness.\n\nAdmittedly, I have history here, so this review may be somewhat biased. I've been [[coming]] here [[since]] the advent of AYCE sushi in this town. Though I've ventured off to try other places, I somehow always [[find]] myself [[back]] here. It [[sort]] of has a \""Cheersish\"" vibe for me.\n\nThe [[main]] reason I [[love]] it here is that I [[know]] I will get fresh, consistent product. I have [[never]] received anything [[less]] than that. At a lot of [[places]] in town, you [[may]] receive old or frozen fish which is very disconcerting. Sushi-mon somehow always has [[beautifully]] fresh fish. \n\nIn addition, they are [[FAST]]! [[I]] order something (in most cases, LOTS of things) and it's on the table in 5 minutes. Sushi-mon chefs seem to get a kick out of the people who order ridiculous amounts of food, so they send it out as quick as they can. \n\nSpeaking of the staff, they are as friendly as can be. Fransisco is my \""go-to\"" server and he always takes care of us. Paul, the busser/runner, knows us well too and always keeps our drinks filled and our table clean. \n\nBut on to the food...\n\nAs I said, we usually order our fair share of nigiri: hamachi, garlic tuna, aji, hirame, hotate with yuzu...but our favorites are the hokkigai (surf clam) and sake (salmon). I've never had surf clam as fresh and delicious as theirs. If you've tried surf clam somewhere else and [[hated]] it, try it here. Trust me.\n\nThe rolls are no [[joke]] as well. Some favorites are the Yebisu, Stacey and Hurricane roll, but I've yet to try one I didn't like. Another tip: you can get most rolls in \""hand roll\"" form. I [[like]] to get yumyum scallops, california and spider rolls that way. Also, try some baked green mussels. They're creamy and briny, yet sweet and unctuous. If you're still hungry after all that, get the Frying Jason roll. It's delicious, but it'll put you over the edge. Their side dishes (miso soup, tempura shrimp, sesame chicken, calamari) are terrific as well. \n\nOk. That's enough. This review is making me hungry.

I went here for their new customer cleaning discount. I made the appointment last week. I showed up 15 minutes before my 2:00 o'clock appointment as requested. The front doors were locked, no one visible in the office, no response to knocking, no closed sign or \""Back at [clock]...\"". After pounding on the door in the rain for several minutes before calling the office's phone. A person who claimed to work for a 'sister practice' answered, confirmed my appointment, and put me on hold while he tried to get ahold of someone in the office. After several minutes in the rain, he told me that he could only reach an answering machine. I left.\n\nI have never been so grossly disrespected by what's purported to be a business. I have never seen such colossal unprofessionalism. This business and medical practice does not give a fig about its patients'/customers' time. Judging by the other reviews here, I clearly dodged a bullet.

So here goes.. Like some other reviewers, I have never had a bad experience going for teppenyaki ... but, what a disaster.  \n\nSo, we made a reservation for 6pm, and when we made it, the person taking the call made it sound like they were so busy, with limited availability.  When we arrived, the restaurant was virtually empty, and with a scour (arriving at literally 6.01) the hostess snarled \""we've been waiting for you\"".. \n\nGot to the table, at 6.02, and there were 2 other people waiting, I joked.. Sorry to keep you guys waiting.  They laughed, but the last laugh was on us, because there were another 6 people joining our table with a 6.15 reservation.  \n\nI ordered a drink, neat... when it arrived, there was a piece of something floating in the glass.  I very quietly asked the hostess/manager as I'm learning to replace the drink.  She took it back to the owner of the restaurant, and the chef, who inspected the glass, and discussed it.. then nothing.\n\nThe waiter came over around 10 minutes later (we were all wondering what was going on at the table.. there was a mix of frustration and silliness because of how disorganized the place was).. No apology, the waiter asked if I would like something else.. I said sure, how about the same in a clean glass?  (in a nice way).. \n\nAnyway, here is a summary of it all.. \nFood was really a 1/5, \n\nTook 50 minutes just to see food coming to the table?  (this is cut up vegetables, and proportioned meat?)\n\n1.  my daughters chicken was placed on the grill frozen, and came like rubber.\n2.  The salad was ripped out of a bag, with some sub par Japanese dresing\n3.  The steak, was over cooked (even though we asked for it prepared rare\n4.  The salmon was fishy, and lacked any real flavor other than old stale fish.\n\nBill comes, I was double charged for the drink, and the waiter out of his pocket took out the $5 saying he would have to pay.  (go figure, I hand a dirty glass to the manager, and the poor guy has to pay)... \n\nAnyway, this place was better a couple years ago.. now its just awful (food, service you name it)... I do recommend looking elsewhere.

I know that mechanics mark up parts, but triple is ridiculous. I called around and ended up getting a quote from Gino's in Plaza Midwood for 30% less.

We were greeted by a very annoyed looking waitress, and when my stepdad asked for a table closer to the tv( no one in the place) she rolled her eyes and did. To make matters worse, we could smell the bathroom. (We weren't even close to it.) I couldn't find the spaghetti pie so I ordered the Mediterranean meal and my stepdad ordered the lasagna.

When parking uptown, they are really your only option.  Which is fine, as some of their lots have reasonable rates.  My reason for the low review comes from the user experience side of thing, and their overall customer service.\n\nMy main problem with them (aside from rude people), is that there is no way to update your payment information online.  My credit card was cancelled, and upon receiving my new card (mid-March), I called immediately to update my information so, come April, they would have updated information.  Obviously I would have much rather done this all online, but alas, there was no other option but to call.  They assured me that the new card was placed on file, and we were good to go.  Fast forward to April 5th, and I receive an email saying that my card did not go through and I would be fined an additional $25.  THEY HAD CHARGED THE WRONG CARD.  They sent me this email on Saturday afternoon, and I immediately called, only to be told that the people who handle payments don't work on weekends and I would need to call back during business hours (the girl could have been a lot nicer).\n\nI call first thing Monday morning, and explain what happen--not in an accusing tone by any means, because I'm well aware that the likelihood of the girl I was speaking to having made this mistake was slim, so why yell at the messenger?  She immediately responded in a defensive tone, saying there is no way that error could have occurred, and it was my fault for not giving them the new information.  I tried to explain again the course of events, and she would not have it.  She updated my credit card information, now for the second time, so let's see if it goes through for May.\n\nOverall, here is how I feel:\n\n+Tremendous amount of parking options offered in Uptown\n-Poor customer service\n-Poor user experience\n-Overpriced\n\nIf you're going to take hundreds of dollars for me every year, at least give me decent people.  And if you don't give me decent people, then give me a way to do what I need to do online so I don't have to deal with them.

We were here at 9 which is a bit before the late night crowd I suppose. The place was practically empty and yet we still waited an age and a day for service. \n\nWe sat a booth not at the bar.

Horrid - stay as far away from this place as you can.  Over-priced, bad food overall.....horrid service. I ordered soup and had a lot left - when asked for a to go container was told they did not have soup to go containers.  Since, I was sick it would have been nice to be able to have the soup later .  Told the manager I was disappointed (guy with the long hair) and he told me he didn't care.  Save your money - the waitress did not get a tip this night, which I never do unless it was just the worst - IT was the worst ever.  The whole place has a feeling of being overwhelmed.

I'm sure I've been eating that this place since before birth.  I was born an raised in Glendale.  \n\nThe hostess that sat us took us to a table that still had plates, and cups from the last customers. We had to point it out to her if she was going to clear the table.  I had the Red Menudo, and my guest had the Carne Asada burrito. The order took 1 hour 20 minutes to get to us.  Burrito was cold to the touch, and other food matter on the plate that I'm thinking was not garnish. I asked that it be redone fresh, which it was. I waited to eat because my guest was w/o her order.  When food was brought back out, I was asked if I wanted mine reheated at which said no. My Red Menudo was orange in color, and the broth/caldo had no taste to it at all. This was a waist of 2 hours of my Sunday.

I went here on a date with my husband on Saturday in the late afternoon. When we walked in a guy greeted us and he was very nice. We sat down and given menus a few minutes later. They don't have very much variety on their menu which was disappointing. Our waitress came to the table and she was not the friendliest. I ordered chips and salsa and the mac and cheese. My husband ordered some kind of sandwich and it came with salad as well. We waited and waited for the chips and salsa that never came. The guy who originally greeted us brought our food. A few minuted later the waitress came over and said, \""Oh, we don't have chips so that's why you did not get your chips\"". She did not apologize and just walked away. That would have been nice to know before so maybe I could have ordered a different appetizer. Our waitress never checked on us again and did not ask how we liked the food. I did like the mac and cheese, but I don't think I would go out of my way to go here again. I also liked the salad that came with my husbands meal.

Don't know why this place got such good reviews, 4 1/2 stars! I was staying at Palace Station, so naturally I wanted to try this place because of all the good reviews. I got the combo pan roast like everyone suggested on yelp and there was nothing good to say about it except for the 3 pieces of lobster that was in there and the few shrimp. You could barely see any crab meat in there. The rice that came with it was soggy and clumpy and not enough when comparing the pan roast and rice ratio. \n\nPros: \n-It was just a short walk away since I was staying at the hotel.\n-the waitress and cook were nice \n\nCons: based on the combo pan roast that I got. \n-rice, way too soggy and clumpy, and not enough for the pan roast.\n-the combo pan roast was overpriced for what you get.

I always get the same thing, Jamaican Jerk Chicken.  OK, yeah, call me boring.  So I know what it tastes like.  And it always tasted the same until last Sunday, when it was different.  After a few bites i realized what I ordered isn't what I got.  So I handed it off to the manager looking dude and told him I'd prefer to get what I actually ordered.  His response was to bring it back to my table and try to convince me that what I had was what i actually ordered.  \n\nBye bye, Chandler Rumbi, I won't be back.  Mistakes are OK, they just need to be corrected.  Explain aways are not OK.

I stopped into Daphne Cafe early this winter for a falafel wrap. I thought the falafel itself was pretty right on - nice crispy exterior with warm soft center and decent flavor. But the wrap was a white tortilla from Sysco (the tortillas were in the display case behind the counter, that's how I know! Tacky!) which I thought was gross and weird. I mean even Sysco sells pita, which would have been a slight improvement. My next pet peeve about this falafel is that there were no cucumbers on it. My next pet peeve is that there were pale-totally-unripe-flavorless tomatoes on it. Sorry, I just hate pale tomatoes; if they are not in season or ripe, please spare me. The lettuce was iceberg, not the biggest deal. It had tahini on it, so that was right. \n\nI don't think I will go back to see if they use higher quality ingredients in other menu items.

Found ourselves at Bachi after a long weekend, hungry for food that wasn't fast food,  yet not lemme-just-stuff-myself-silly buffet style either. Overall: love the concepts and menu but with a couple hangups!\n\nFOOD: downright [[delicious]]. Not gonna lie, I was pretty [[impressed]]. We ordered the truffle fries ($5.5) (medium cut, parm cheese, truffle gravy drizzle + sun-dried tomato aioli)...what in the holy hayellllll. This was so amazing! I could eat this literally as a side to every meal. The truffle wasn't overwhelming and I love the substitute of the aioli for like, Heintz ketchup or something. Very classy, Bachi. The Kiki burger ($11) was #1) cutely named and #2) cooked to perfection with the best flavor combo ever! I loved the bun, as it was somewhat sweet and pillowy. It had a mix of mushrooms, a bacon/sweet onion glaze and gruyere cheese. \n\nSERVICE: Not that great. It took a long time to get our food (30+ minutes). We were only 4 girls and didn't order anything out of the ordinary or massive amounts of food. Heck, the restaurant wasn't even that busy .. not all the tables were full, so I'm still a bit stumped why it took so long.\n\nDRINKS: The lychee boba milk tea was aiiiiight. Nothing special. They didn't put enough ice, so it was a bit warm and milky.. not really what I hoped for in 100+ degree weather. The lychee flavor was good though and not overwhelming.\n\nOVERALL: Satisfied, good for a try, not sure if I would go out of my way for this again, but if you do, it'll be a good choice!

This review will use the arbitrary rating system I use for all karaoke bars. See my lists for details.\n\nBar Zo\u00e9 Karaoke Et Cocktails (etc.) is probably one of the [[best]] karaoke bars in Montreal. It does a lot of things really well, [[nothing]] really badly, and a few things...surprisingly--and comes on [[top]] in almost every respect.\n\nSinging:\n\nZo\u00e9's singing setup is the [[best]] I've seen anywhere. Singers (up to two live microphones) have a stage to themselves next to the DJ booth, and can easily read the lyrics from two visible screens. The acoustic is set up smartly with sensitive mics, invisible but powerful monitors and good instrumental tracks. The song selection is serviceable and often includes more than one version of popular tunes. If you've picked out a duet by mistake, the DJ will sing with you, even if he doesn't know the lyrics. He's a trooper.\n\nFor the best conditions in town to absolutely destroy a song, I give Zo\u00e9's five Busted Microphones.\n\nBooze:\n\nThis is Zo\u00e9's weakest point, which means it's merely good.\n\nThe selling point of their bar menu is obviously the cocktails, being in the business name and all. They're tasty, generally sweet items for people who prefer their poison colourful. The full list of available mixed drinks is quite exhaustive and you can expect to find something right for you. The beer, on the other hand, is [[somewhat]] disappointing, with a limited selection of somewhat overpriced brands on tap. Still, with such a solid offering, your friends will soon find it in themselves to belt out their best Sinatra.\n\nFor a great variety at the expense of decent cheap beer, Zo\u00e9 receives four Bohemian Rhapsodies.\n\nExtras:\n\nThis is where this place really shines. \n\nLet's agree that Karaoke is a gimmick to sell alcohol to groups who normally would not be inclined to close a bar, let even go to one. Zo\u00e9 recognized this and ran with it. They will gimmick the crap out of you.\n\nBefore the Karaoke starts, the bar doubles as a specialized fondue restaurant (!), and demonstrates a staggering dedication to the concept. The white tablecloths, the reusable towelettes, the wine card, the actually pretty great food and all the details I missed; it's like they're secretly ashamed of being a Karaoke bar. This makes for a mighty fine evening.\n\nThere are some other inspired decisions. The songbooks are actually computers with keyboard screwed into the walls; you can look up songs by title or artist name almost immediately, provided you know what you are looking for. Singers have their back to a giant screen where onlookers can easily read the lyrics and sing along. There is a smallish dance floor. The gambling room is entirely isolated from the main bar. The restrooms are way classier than they have any reason to be.\n\nFor outdoing themselves in any conceivable respect, Zo\u00e9 gets five Awesomes out of a possible five.\n\nAs with any Karaoke bar, your night will largely by defined by the people with you. That being said, once you are ready to surprise your coworkers with that one song you sing really well, you'd be hard pressed to find a better stage than Zo\u00e9's. It's relentless assault of genuine coolness on what is essentially a kitschy activity will win the hearts of even the most stuck-up anti-singing drones. Five stars.

I love radish cake with egg, and they do not disappoint here. Beautifully crunchy on the outside, wonderfully creamy on the inside... goes well with some hot soy milk, sweetened with table sugar.  Also recommend their champion rice roll with spicy pickles. It's not too hot, just sour crunch with heat tempered with sweet pork fung.

I'm sad to write this because I love the drinks here. I have always gone to Saltys in the other locations and after moving to glendale, this one is not far from me so I've gone twice now and each time got [[worse]]. The first time it seemed like we were in the way of social hour for the wait staff and this time even though they were open and it was happy hour we could only get house margaritas as the machine hasn't been prepared for customers. The bartender was the only wait staff on duty and he was put out to have to even talk to us, after one drink we couldn't get out of there quick enough. They are not usually busy there so you would think they would take all the free time they have to service the customers that are there that give them a paycheck.

So I went on Priceline which btw is another serious issue because when you buy package deals from them; they don't let you pick the time or day you want to come in. Anyways back to the crappy hotel that is the Excalibur. It wasn't just the fact it was cheap looking and smelled like your Grandmas house that has 20 cats and smoke a pack a day; it was the customer service, the lack of housekeeping and the overly priced rooms that are not worth your money. My sister and I stayed for four days and not once did our room get cleaned. My sister left a mark on the sheets to see if they would be switched the next day and sure enough they were never switched. On top of that the lights went out and they wanted to charge me $130 to extend my check out for 2 hours. The customer service is horrific, especially for a Vegas hotel. I get the hotel is old and everything but come on people, have some pride. My sister lost her phone and asked customer service and the lady was SO RUDE to her and just said \""im sorry but I didn't see a phone\"", without even looking. So my sister goes to the manager and complains about the rudeness and also about her phone Sure enough the phone was in lost and found!\n\nPeople even if your looking for a cheap reasonable hotel...don't even waste your money. Stay at the Luxor which is nicer and reasonable and actually give a shit about their guests!

Awesome little mom and pop type place been here about 3 times already. First time I did the all-you-can-eat dogs for 8.99. Ate about 6 hot dogs, some onion rings, and a Dr. Pepper.  There is a HUGE range of toppings you can put on your dogs offered at the buffet which include: pickles, jalapenos, sliced or diced onions, nacho cheese, chili, tomatoes, relish, chicago relish, real crumbled bacon, deli mustard, regular mustard, ketchup (purists aside), etc. etc. the list goes on. Pretty much anything you can dream of! I also came in during a transition period between breakfast and lunch and one of the staff said to have at it with the breakfast buffet if I wanted. Awesome bonus! Grabbed some biscuits and poured some country gravy over those bad boys before diggin' into my dogs.\n\nSecond time around I brought my roommate and we had the all-you-can-eat buffet crab legs and prime rib for 18.99 (friday and saturday only). Felt bad about using the $10 for 20 yelp deal because I really like to support local businesses. Prime rib was pretty good, it was actually like really thin cuts of beef almost like roast beef don't be expecting a huge slab of meat and you'll be ok. It was pretty tasty, had about 4 plates of that.  The snow crab/king crab leg mix was extremely sweet, and fresh. Very high quality.  There was a bit of a wait time in between batches when the crab ran out, but it was [[worth]] the wait.  My roommate really liked the food, and the staff even made a special request of sunnyside up eggs to go with his prime rib. +++\n\nThird time did the hot dogs and sandwiches for 10.99. The Pizza STEAK is amazing! I think I can probably eat about 12 of those it's so good I can't describe it. [[Or]] maybe because my vocabulary is limited. Regardless its [[delicious]] go out and [[get]] one! [[Also]] had the cordon bleu sandwich which was pretty good, but [[I]] think i'll [[stick]] with the steak sandwiches.  [[Also]] had about 2 [[jalapeno]] dogs and loaded them up with toppings. \n\nMan I'm [[kind]] of drooling just thinking about it. I just [[went]] [[yesterday]] and I'm tempted to go again but I'll save some money. Love this place and I love to support local mom and pop joints.

Took close to 20 minutes for an incredibly bland burger and mediocre fries. They couldn't even give me a full cup of ketchup. Absolutely not worth the money. How could anyone eat here on their lunch break? Save your time and money and hit Cookout.

I have been looking for a timeshare to use.  I reviewed Marriott, Disney, and finally Hilton.  I decided against Marriott and will now go with Disney.  This Hilton experience was [[high]] [[pressure]] trying to get me to sign now.  [[Completely]] opposite of the other brands I visited.  Compared to the other facilities this Hilton is in [[poor]] condition, their offerings are small compared to others (although they verbally state they have more properties, which they might, but they are their hotels of which the bulk are lower quality).  They [[spend]] a lot of time showing sites through their partner RCI of which Disney also uses.  I [[simply]] did not see the value here, did not appreciate the experience, and the cost is much higher than Disney for less value (value as measured by what I and my family are looking for).  \n\nTo be fair if Hilton had more of the value you are looking for, then this might work for you.

Horrible. Just plain horrible. Like the other review, get one star cause I have to. Ordered a small chili with cheese. Asked for some chili sauce packets on the side. A spicy chicken sandwich combo with a side of ranch. The wifey was nice enough to get it in the first place, so I can't complain to her. No ranch. No chili sauce. No spoon to eat the chili. No straw for the drink. No napkins to wipe hands with. Did get ketchup for the fries, but didn't eat them because they were colder than the ice in my drink. I was soooooo angry I actually called. The manager offered to give me the stuff if I drove down and pick up the items. There was no mention of a refund or a gift card for a future order. Doesn't matter because I won't be going back.

I work in the food industry and have no issue to pay 10 dollars for a great burger, while sitting at the bar the gentlemen next to me was not happy about the price, it happens. I ordered to go and when I got home and my wife and I ate our burger I saw why the gentleman at the bar was not happy. \nGuys have you ever seen salt and pepper helps bring out flavor when you order a med burger and pay 10 dollars for it make sure it is med not well done. If I wanted a well done burger I would go to the golden arches as their well done is better than yours and they suck.\nWhen your main item is burgers you have to get it correct or you will not be around long and if they continue to serve the dry tasteless burgers that I received I don't see you been around \n\nWould never go back yuk yuk yuk

\""[[No]].\""  \n\nIf you ask me about eating at Papaya Thai, that is what I will say. \n\n0 stars for the single kinda scattered and scruffy staffperson.  \n\n0 stars for the cook who cannot prepare an offering from the menu as the menu describes it.\n\nIn this case, I was down to two remaining untried Thai restaurants within quick reach of the Valley Metro Limo, and both in Tempe.  The other half was in Tampa, and since he does not care much for Thai, I get the chance to try one.  \n\nThe limo arrived at Southern and Mill at 5:17 PM, and connected me with another limo at Broadway. With traffic, getting to McClintock took nearly 15 minutes.  On exiting the limo, 5:50 PM, I walked back about half a block to the restaurant.\n\nOn entering the restaurant, I picked up a menu and rang the bell and a somewhat harried staff person came to greet me.  He asked me where I wanted to sit, at a table with 1 bench looking directly into the side of a huge fish tank...or the next table, which would leave no buffer between myself and the only other table seated in the restaurant.  \n\nThere are at least 120 seats in this restaurant.  Why so fiercely contain people in the first three tables close to the door?  You must get your business in fits and hurries and keeping only the 3 tables active is working for you?  Then again, your telling me you are the only staffperson does not surprise me.  The Help Wanted sign on the door was more than an indication that Help is NEEDED!\n\nWhen I was seated, staffperson offered to bring water.  The phone rang and he was off, as he offered another version of \""I am the only staffperson here...\""  I looked at the menu and made my decision. In the menu, there is a $2 charge listed for sharing.  This goes against everything Thai I have ever known.  The traditional Thai meal has everyone enjoying some of each dish served.  Because of my proximity to the fish tank, I was quite up close and personal with the fish. The water probably isn't [[filthy]], but the plexiglass tank is not helping the perception. \n\n6 PM, as the cellphone chime reminds me of the passing of an hour.  I am waiting for water and a staffperson who can take my order. 6:01, the staffperson comes, bearing a pitcher of water and a (My eyes are rolling in opposite directions because I am either overworked or stoned) smile.  He filled up my glass and asked if I was ready to order.  I replied that I was and ordered Som Tom, the Thai name for the green papaya salad. Staffperson replied that he did not know the Thai names for the menu items.  The phone rang again.\n\nStaffperson's attention was no longer on me.  The phone, his Pavlovian stimuli, had taken him away.  I asked if he had heard me.  He replied that he needed to go answer the phone.  He asked if I minded waiting, as he was the only staffperson.  I said I would wait.  Off he went, in pursuit of electronic interaction.  \n\n6:10 PM, staffperson returns, apologizing for the telephone delay and asking about my order.  I ordered the papaya salad without the green beans and steamed rice on the side.  Staffperson took the order and went to the kitchen.  The phone rang as he left the table,  his pace quickening as he approached the phone.  \n\n6:18 PM, the door opens and 2 potential patrons enter.  The bell rings and staffperson rushes to the waitstand to greet 2 new patrons.  \n\n6:20 PM, staffperson returns. He brings the salad and a bowl of rice.  The salad that appears has some of the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not have cucumber, shredded lettuce or cilantro.  On sending back the initial preparation, staffperson returned with the original preparation, advising the chef stated \""This is a traditional Thai presentation of the dish\"".  I sent the order back, citing the inconsistencies and asking for a new presentation.\n\n6:25 pm.  As I empty my water glass, the salad I received previously is returned, minus the cucumber.  In asking staffperson if this is a new presentation or if it is an attempt to correct the original, he replied that he did not know.  I stood and left.  While the advertisement on the window of the establishment says they have \""The Best Curry in the Valley\"",   they will get no second chance to prove it to me.  For all the phone activity, there was no one who came to pick up a carry-out order.  Between this and the somewhat glazed staffperson, I have to wonder if this place is not a front for a drug business.

I was a fan of this place 10 years ago and moved out of state. I recently moved back and was excited to take my partner and out of town guests to this eatery!  It was awful, long wait, skimpy sandwich, loud music on patio, so loud and somewhat abrasive when the singer talked to the audience. I couldn't hear or talk to the person sitting right next to me.   This was the 29th and a Sunday brunch.  Disappointed, will not go back, especially since there are so many new and fantastic eateries in Phoenix!  You can't rely on a name, Duck and Decanter, your poor service, etc will catch up and you will not survive.  My advice to all who ask,  where is a good place to eat, I will say not Duck and Decanter!

Hands down the worst target I've ever been to. Grew up in this neighborhood and even in high school it was still a nightmare. Unorganized, dirty, never well-stocked and the patrons...YIKES. I know that probably shouldn't factor into my rating but good God, this is the one place I am guaranteed to be run over by a rogue cart of a mother of 8 kids under the age 10 who's letting one of those 8 wield the cart. Unacceptable.

Waited less than 10 minutes at 8:45 am on a Saturday for a table outside (had the dog with us). Waitlist sends you a quick text when the table is ready - and the text includes a link to the menu. Nice touch. We were quickly served - had tofu scramble, wife had breakfast burrito and soy latte. Food was great. Service was attentive yet unobtrusive. Prices were more than fair for the quality of food served. They have doggie bowls for water if you're there with Fido.\n\nWill definitely [[return]] again. Tip from the waitstaff: Arrive well before 9 am on the weekends as it tends to get extremely busy 10:15 am onwards on the weekends. Not a [[problem]] for us at all.

I usually love places with a 50's diner atmosphere and walking into this place, it was no exception - it's cute. The jukebox, booths, decor, etc, etc make this a fun-looking place. The food (I had a burger) was okay, but nothing special. On another occasion, I went in with the sole purpose of getting a chocolate malt to go for my boyfriend and it was over $6 for just a malt. That was the point when I realized I would [[never]] be back to 5 & Diner. I think that's outrageous and hell, they're almost robbing you.

I stayed in this hotel a couple nights and while it wasn't terrible, it still left a lot to be desired. It is in a pretty good location, between Fremont and the activity at the south end of the strip, but you will still need to drive or take a taxi to those areas.\n\nThe room we got was [[mediocre]] and did not really have a view of anything other than a wall. There were some stains inside the drawers and the tissue box was [[never]] replenished. And on the last night, the shower/bathtub drain clogged!\n\nThere's a $7.50 per night resort fee in addition to the regular charge that is supposed to cover these amenities, but obviously it wasn't enough! This fee also gives you access to the top of the tower, which is listed as a $60 value. This doesn't include the rollercoaster and so all you can do is look around. That's cool and all, but why would it even cost $60 to ride up an elevator? And once was enough.\n\nThe casino part itself is pretty decent, and the buffet is an okay price for being on the strip.\n\nThis is not a bad establishment, but as far as staying over here, it could definitely use some improvements.

So I've ordered from this Cugino's [[location]] about 5 times now and here are my thoughts.  In regards to their customer [[service]], they have been great every time.  I call and order, they tell me when the order will be ready, and when I get there it is.  That may sound simplistic, but it's kinda [[nice]] that every time I've called, they've kept their time frame honest and accurate.\nThe pizza is great.  It's different than the Maryland location because they use a brick oven as opposed to a traditional pizza oven, but the results are very [[good]]. The crust/cheese/sauce is just right and absolutely a true NY style slice.  The garlic [[knots]] are the [[standard]] boring variety that most places in town sell.

Ok, here's the thing.. I like Icehouse ok.  I've met my husband there for lunch several times.  I've just not been wowed by the two big things I look for in a dining establishment.  Food and service.\n\nThe food is ok.  I can't say I've had anything that's really bad, but nothing really memorable, either.  Once, the buttermilk fried chicken was super good, but on a repeat visit, it was tough and the gravy was watery.\n\nAs for service, I've not been impressed at all.  I've only ever seen female waitstaff, but they never smile, or try to convey that they're remotely interested that anyone is there.  It makes for a rather boring experience, in my opinion.  I'm not saying they need to sit down and ask for my life story, but at least smile.\n\nI'm not saying I won't go back, I probably will, but this place is way down on my list of places I would enjoy frequenting.

I learned so much about hair today!  When I went in, my hair looked like absolute crap.  I'd had a bad experience letting a new person cut my hair, so I was extremely anxious about this appointment.  But I can say with certainty that I have never sat in the chair of a hair stylist who knows more about hair.  Kelly Z  really knows her shit.  She took the nastiest, botched up cut and made it awesome.  The things she taught me may be common knowledge to everyone else, but I am utterly incompetent when it comes to hair.  I had no idea that by washing my hair every day, I was stripping all the moisture from my hair and combined with this dry Wisconsin [[winter]] (something I know nothing about, having spent 22 years in the south), I had created so much static electricity that I couldn't flip a light switch without getting shocked!  Anyway, I'm [[incredibly]] happy with my haircut; Kelly Z did an amazing job with everything.  Also, Rosa gave me the best eyebrow wax I've ever had.  [[No]] slapping on some hot wax and ripping out your hair.  This girl takes her [[time]] and does a thorough job.  [[I]] could barely even feel when she pulled off the strips.

Yet again severely disappointed in how US Airways handles their business. Poorly operated, poor customer service representatives, and over-all lack of commitment to the patrons that frequent their business. Yet more delays without a good reason behind them and with no plan in place to resolve said delays. I would recommend paying a higher price for flights with their competitors as at least Delta, Southwest, and United are much easier to work with.

I've been to BRGR a few times now, and each time I walk away thinking that it should be called MLKSHK or APPTZR, because there's nothing good about their burgers, themselves.\n\nI'm a big fan of the salty caramel milkshake with bourbon, and the fried pickles are really good, but everything else that I've ever tried has always fallen flat, from the ahi burger...to a regular burger...to the sante fe hippie veggie burger. I've tried REALLY hard to be impressed, but it's just not happening. The buns are dry, the burgers are overpriced, and the flavors are simply lacking the interest to justify going back. If I'm paying a premium price for an a la carte burger, there are better establishments in Pittsburgh to choose from.\n\nNot to mention, the beer prices at BRGR are laughable. $7 for a Strongbow bottle? You've got to be kidding me. I guess they've got to get all the money out of you during your visit since the food isn't going to be bringing you back.

I've been to [[Sushi]] [[Kame]] [[lots]] of [[times]], and it's always a [[great]] experience.  [[I]] [[would]] [[definitely]] [[say]] it's my [[favorite]] sushi place in the area. \n\nThey [[start]] you out with a free [[cucumber]] and somen [[noodle]] salad.  It's small, but very [[appetizing]].  I still can't figure out exactly what the dressing is, but I always drink the extra.  After that they give you a (also free) miso soup, which is pretty good as far as miso soup goes.    Oh, and the green tea is free and they use real matcha as far as I can tell.  It's got a really nice, light, floral taste.\n\nI've also been to Yellowfin a few times.  While Yellowfin is good, the reason that [[I]] [[like]] [[Sushi]] [[Kame]] more is probably their \""American Sushi\"" combo.  For about $14, you get three pieces of salmon nigiri, three tuna nigiri, a salmon roll, and the house salad, which is lettuce with ginger dressing.  The slabs of fish on the nigiri are [[nicely]] cut and usually pretty thick, giving the [[sushi]] a rice-to-fish ratio that definitely favors the fish.   Speaking of the fish, it has [[always]] been [[fresh]] and clean-tasting, never \""[[fishy]].\""  Admittedly, I've only had non-midwest sushi once, so my basis for comparison is only other sushi in Illinois.  \n\nWhen it comes to maki, I usually stick with the simpler stuff that lets you taste the fish more, so I can't offer much of an opinion on the super tempura fried california rolls or whatever.  The unagi rolls are good though.\n\nI've had the sea urchin here as well, and while it's softer than the stuff at Yellowfin, there's also more of it and it tastes really, really good.

Taken my daughter to this office a few times, but won't anymore. The good points- the office is clean. The staff that answers the phone is nice and usually helpful.  The hygienists are all really nice and are kid friendly.  On the downside- when you walk into this place it just feels cold.  The staff won't even greet you since you have to sign in at a computer.  Dr. Ash wasn't as kid-friendly and a little bullish with my daughter.  I understand she was crying, but she didn't do anything to make her feel more comfortable.

First, I want to say from my experience, Chompie's food is very good. Not excellent, but very good.  The service, on the other hand was very poor.  Chompie's is a bit on the expensive side. If there service was good, I might accept that but with poor service, I can't give it higher than 2 stars. \n\nI went to the bakery during lunchtime on Sept. 13th. It was busy so I waited in line like everyone else. As I moved along in line I was asked for my order which included a few bagels, some cookies and a takeout sandwich.  So I'm pulled out of line by one lady who want to ring up my order at this cash register at the stat of the line, not at the end of the line where you usually pay.  I start to take out my wallet and she tells me credit card only, if I want to pay with cash,  I have to get back in line and wait for the OTHER cash register.  O.K. I give her my credit card to pay, but I'm thinking that was annoying. \n\nShe tells me my takeout order will be ready soon. It was a simple bagel sandwich.  So I wait, and wait, and wait. 15 minutes later I ask the lady for the status of this, and it turns out the lady never sent the order to the kitchen so of course its not going to be done.  5 more minutes and its finally done.\n\nThey need to get a bit more organized and provide better service, or I can tell you I will never be back.

It's Dillards at the Fashion Show Mall so I thought my experience might be less ghetto than one of the other malls.... Not so much! Let's start with parking. I drive around and waited by two different vehicles people were getting into. The first lady must have fallen asleep once inside the car because there was no movement and no tail lights after the door closed. After a brief eternity, I decided to try again. Two ladies walking to a car. They first open the back of the car and start rifling through some bags. Then they go to the trunk and-more rifling. Then they decide to stop and have a deep conversation outside the car. By this point, I'm fuming but the place is packed, do I wait. Finally, the snot who is the driver of this car starts to escort her friend back to the walkway as if she isn't competent to find her way. Now I'm [[livid]]. Finally she walks back to the car and makes a five point turn to exit the space. But I digress....\n\nOnce inside the store, I headed to the ladies' dresses. They had a massive selection....for people size 10 and larger. I did find a dress that I didn't despise but I clearly needed a size larger than I found. Naturally, it was the last one so I decided I'd pick up Spanx and squeeze into this one rather than torture myself any longer. Off to shoes. I'm not a shopping fan so it did not thrill me that here too was a massive selection. I found two pair of shoes that looked perfect. I couldn't seem to get any hello even though employees were just standing around chatting about freeway directions. Finally, a young man did come help me. I received the first pair of shoes but he had yet to bring me the stockings to use for try-ons. I finally gave up on waiting and found them myself. The second pair of shoes were not available in anything other than behemoth size. The first pair was missing rhinestones on BOTH of the $80 shoes. I asked for another pair in my size but, alas, none were available. The young salesman gave a nervous smile and made a comment about small stones and glue not holding. I nearly made a comment about his stones but chose to quit while I was behind. I left the store extremely [[frustrated]] by my experience and was just thankful leaving the store was actually pleasant.

It's Dillards at the Fashion Show Mall so I thought my experience might be less ghetto than one of the other malls.... Not so much! Let's start with parking. I drive around and waited by two different vehicles people were getting into. The first lady must have fallen asleep once inside the car because there was no movement and no tail lights after the door closed. After a brief eternity, I decided to try again.

This restaurant was a great find for us on our recent vacation to Scottsdale, AZ.  We were headed to a matinee showing of the Dark Knight Rises movie at Fashion Square Mall, so we looked around for a place to grab lunch in the area.  \n\nWe picked Culinary Dropout because we liked the witty name.

We had to order an extra bowl of pretzel bites because they were so good.  Then came the main course...  \n\nI asked the waiter for some recommendations of their \""specialty items\"", and he pointed me to their fried chicken with mashed potatoes, biscuits and honey drizzle (over all of it).

And am I [[glad]] [[I]] did!\n\nThe crust on the chicken was so brown and crispy and the honey glaze gave it a hint of sweetness.  The mashed potatoes were creamy and wonderful as they were topped with cream gravy.  And last but not least were the fluffy and light biscuits.  Having grown up in the South, I've had some good meals of fried chicken, biscuits and mashed potatoes, and I would put this one right up at the top.  I didn't eat all 3 pieces of chicken, but what I did have was amazing!\n\nFinally, the women ordered a caramel popcorn & pudding dessert that was totally different than anything I had eaten before, but it was just as [[wonderful]] as everything else we ate that [[day]].\[[n]]\nIf you have a [[chance]] to [[check]] out Culinary Dropout, [[I]] [[would]] [[highly]] [[recommend]] you do so.

I live right around the corner from Los Cabos, and so I am particularly interested in having a good \""Mex\"" restaurant nearby. I've now been there probably two dozen times since they opened a few months ago, so I feel like I can give them a fair review. \nFirst, the owners are very very nice and interested in feedback. Second, the food is, on the whole, very very tasty and cheap. I am a particular fan of the tortas and burritos. The chorizo breakfast burrito is a knock-out as is the \""California Surfing\"" burrito, with carne asada, shrimp, french fries, and a garlicy sour cream sauce. \nThe only gripe I have is that the food isn't always consistent. I've twice had inedible items served to me. Once with a carne asada torta that was so over salted as to be inedible (and I really like salt) and once with a pollo asada burrito where the chicken was so dry as to not be chewable. These two extreme outliers (everything else I've ever had there -- including these two menu items on other occasions -- has been delicious) are just a symptom of lack of consistency that I hope will get ironed out soon. \nIt's also a big annoyance that their hours keep changing. When I want a burrito, I don't want to show up to find they're now closed on Sundays or only open at 10am in the morning when I've shown up at 9am. I think this will work out, though. \nI have my fingers crossed for them. The food is awesome 9 times out of 10 and the local friendliness makes up for the other times. At least, it will for now.

Stopped here on the way out of town.  \n\n1.  Almost all the slot machines might as well have come from the fire sale at Binions downtown.  They were old.\n\n2.  We've heard the buffet is outstanding.  We'll never know, the line was excruciatingly long.  Only two cashiers working at a multiple cashier station.\n\n3.  Coffee Shop:  Again with only one cashier at a two cashier station.  There was a line of 15 people snaking through the dining area waiting to pay on the way out.  This is inexcuseable . . . when's the first or last time you've seen that?\n\n4.  Food at Coffee Shop:  Bland smothered in tasteless.  I had the open faced turkey sandwich.  The dressing had no sage, no poultry seasoning, no salt.  Gorgeous had poached eggs soft and they came out hard, twice.\n\nNo need to stop here again.

Poor management has caused me to add gran agave to my banned list. I had been a weekly customer since they opened and will never return after the GM accused me of using an invalid coupon. Not my fault that DoubleTakeDeals has a buggy website.  Instead of politely making me aware of an issue he makes a scene in front of his customers. All over a two dollar coupon.  I have eaten there hundreds of times.  Good food but I and my co-workers will never return.  Shameful treatment of a formerly loyal long-time customer.  Very insulting.

Visited today for lunch... there were 7 of us.  The food was just okay.  I had a truffle burger and we all shared side items including French Fries (shoestring fries that are HORRIBLE and cold), a house pickle plate that includes a variety of pickled items (carrots, mushrooms, beets, etc., also YUCK), and were supposed to share a plate of fried pickles which were forgotten and never brought to the table.  Aside from the crappy food, soda is served by the bottle (so be prepared to shell out $3 for each 12 oz bottle you drink).... and the real clincher: on top of the 20% gratuity they automatically added to the bill, they added AN EXTRA 20% SERVICE CHARGE simply for being a party of 6 or more.  Nope, sorry... never again!  Good luck surviving in SLS where the hotel smell alone made me want to vomit!

Food was okay... Teppanyaki Chef was fun and good but other service was not so good.\n\nThings made me sad:\n#1. Long waiting time... Took waiter for very long time to stop by and bring us check... The restaurant wasn't really full capacity. It is either manager is too cheap to hire more people or someone called in sick...\n\n#2. I brought coupon on Passport on my iPhone.

Good start to our [[trip]].\n\nT&T was our first meal in Vegas after checking in to the Luxor.  Reviews were a little low, so we hadn't planned on eating here, but we wanted something quick and convenient and gave it a try.  \nWe started with an order of guacamole which seemed freshly made and was very good (large portion was more than my wife and I could finish with a meal).  The salsas that came with our chips was also good - chipotle and verde.\nI ordered the combos tacos, which came with barbacoa, carnitas, and chicken.   They were very good and really had a lot of flavor (the chicken [[seemed]] bland next to the others).  My wife ordered a different variety of pork tacos which were very good also.\nThe only [[negative]] was that the beans and rice that came with our meals were a little dry and bland.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed the experience and atmosphere.  I would recommend to anyone staying in the Luxor looking for an easy meal.

N9NE was, in short, a disappointing experience.  I have absolutely no problem spending $50 on a good steak but N9NE was simply not a $200 per couple dining experience.\n\nThe ambiance was not that of a high end steakhouse.  It is as if you are in a nightclub with loud top 40 music playing and mirrored pillars.  There's a way to blend trendy and classy (I enjoy it when it works), however this was well over the top.   This was trendy cheesey.  Example - The drunk patrons at the next table to our left kept \""singing\""  (or better yet screaming and grunting) along to the music as if it was karaoke.  The couple making out at another table next to ours completed the experience - did they order any food or were they just dining on each other's faces all night?\n\nOur server was beyond pretentious and pompous during his chore of waiting on us.  And honestly, there was no reason to be.  I almost pulled him over at one point to tell him to cut the act, I've dined at restaurants with much more class than this one and the service does not need to be this way.  Of course I held back hoping that the food would make up for the atmosphere and service.  \n\nWhile the food was okay, I wouldn't say it blew me away by any means.  Everyone's' steaks were good but the oysters on the half shell were tiny and the lobster on the surf and turf was decidedly bad.\n\nAt the end of the meal I was disappointed that I had wasted my time and money there....there are so many other restaurants in Vegas I would love to try.  I guess if you're staying at the Palms it might be a good choice (although I've heard Alize is good), but to make a trip out from the strip was pointless.

one of the advantages of doing your masters degree at age 33 is that you get to be surrounded by students ten years younger. that youth can be refreshing, enlightenting, de-aging. \n\nit can also lead to having to go to student bars and clubs when those students turn 22 and 23. they will plan their birthday parties at these same bars and clubs.  the advantage of these clubs is that they are often cheap. at stereo, drinks are 1.50.  they could be free, and stereo would easily be the worst club i have ever been to in my entire life.  dont get me wrong, i spent years of my youth going to clubs nearly as bad in other countries- cave themed clubs in mexico where you make out with waiters to get an extra tequila shot, clubs in torremolinos and cancun where foam shoots out of holes and girls pretend theyre bi and make out with eachother. \n\nthis club doesnt even offer that. it does offer possibly the worst dj i have ever heard in my life. a smelly smoke that shoots out at you from the dj stand in amounts that may give your first born an extra limb or cyclops eye.  its filled with high school and maybe first year univ kids whose hooking up, post club will directly lead to the dumbing down of future generations.  the only possible remedy for the horridness that is this club o shit is  that there are pool tables on the main floor. however as the volume of the shit music from above is still enough to make you contemplate suicide, it doesnt compensate sufficiently.\n\nif you have to go, drink at least 9 shots immediately before entering

Tonight was our first and last visit to this place. We're big fans of brewery-type restaurants (especially non chains) and are frequenters of Four Peaks usually, but we unwisely tried to venture out of our usual places tonight. Our list of criticisms - while individually may not be big issues - adds up enough to inspire me to write my first Yelp review in this place's honor. This place may be new, but they have a lot to work on.\n\n- We were seated outside among other patrons for 20 minutes before we were offered service.\n- The beer is not very good. Lager is horrible.\n- Waitress didn't bring menus and acted like it was an effort to get them - at 6 pm.\n- Burgers were overdone. Macaroni & cheese was good, but for $9 we only got a small bowl.\n- Second beers came in plastic cups because by 7 pm they had run out of pint glasses, even though the place was not too busy.\n- There was an attempted illicit transaction between patrons on the patio and someone walking up to the rail. A bouncer had to run over and ask them all to leave. Later, two employees (one a manager of the place) loudly discussed the incident right by us.\n- They apparently ran out of ice, and when the manager was informed, she loudly swore and ran over to call the ice company.\n- Smokers were way too close to the entrances to the building. They also kept sitting on a bench right by our table - still inside the railing - and it just seemed too close to people eating. Maybe we're just spoiled at not having smokers in restaurants now.\n- The waitress Shelly was just unfriendly and not responsive beyond the initial wait. When we would give an order, she would absent mindedly look off in the distance and then have us repeat it. She got cranky when the 1 minute she gave our friend to look at the menu wasn't enough  and she had to come back later - then she waited 10 minutes before the next swing by. We are usually good tippers, but when she gave us the credit card slip without a pen to sign with and without even saying \""thank you\"" on a last attempt to be nice, we barely gave her anything.\n\nNothing redeeming this place.

(from \""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\"" to \""Restaurant Impossible!\"") I understand slow/busy bar service - but this was straight up rudeness and we were ignored for over 20 minutes.\nwe walked in (just two of us) in front of a group of four or so people. The group that came in behind us sat behind us as well, and they had their food before we even were acknowledged and got a glass of water.\nWe tried asking the male waiter for water and he continued past us (ignored us!) and helped the table behind us, taking their order, bringing them several plates of food. The waitress then told us that the other waiter would help us. we were continued to be ignored.\ni felt bad that it was the waitress' first day, but the other waiter was of no assistance to her (or us), which made the entire establishment look bad. He kept walking past our table to serve and check on the group that came behind us.\nit took 20 minutes for a glass of water and an additional 5 to get my coke. we waited over a half hour for the garlic rolls (an appetizer) and about 50 minutes for a \""wee\"" sized pizza. \nMeanwhile the group that came in behind us has had a \""not so wee\"" sized pizza (medium), a couple orders or wings, etc. and the waiter kept bringing out plates for them while we sat with one glass of water. The group of people behind us finished and paid for their meal as our fricking appetizer was coming out.\nthe ONLY reason we didn't just walk away is human courtesy to the poor waitress on her first day.\nLooks like this place needs to be on food network again for the show \""Restaurant Impossible!\"" because the male waiter was a complete ass - either that or he was racist and ignored my boyfriend. I literally saw him make eye contact as we asked for help and he kept it moving to the group just past us...that came in after us!\n\nI will never come back, and i will never tell my out of town guests to come here.

Went at about lunchtime on a Sunday, and there was only about a five minute wait. This is a [[busy]] little place, but seems [[worth]] the wait. The biscuits and gravy were very [[good]], and the portions large. They have a nice selection of mini pies and the entire menu is available all day long. The waitress was very attentive and efficient, and the food was delish. I'll be [[back]]!

[[This]] is such a cool store and such a fun place to shop. They have everything you want for accessories: jewelry, scarves, hats, watches, bags, wallets, glasses, the list goes on. \nIt's conveniently organized by colors so you can shop by what you might need to match your style or clothing and there are so many items to [[choose]] from!!\nI find myself walking around the store so many times to make sure I haven't missed anything!\nNow the fun part is not just the huge selection, but the prices too. Items range from mostly $10-$30 with a few items above and below this, but it makes it affordable to try out a trend or experiment. \nVery [[fun]] store!

I really don't want to give a bad review of this place, but they don't seem to have the same standards for the take-out orders that they do for their dine-ins.\n\nDine ins are great, the food is always excellent. \n\nI've been ordering take out lately and there's always been a problem with my order. \n\nI get the Cabo skillet with homefries, and they keep not including the salsa and sour cream condiments. Today, I didn't get the melted jack cheese on my skillet, which completely killed the meal for me and was the last straw, which is why I'm writing this review. \n\nThey also made my home fries hash browns instead, which were underseasoned and undercooked .\n\nQuite a shame because I get nothing but the cabo skillet and its usually been excellent without any of these problems when I dine in. \n\nI ordered a different skilled and asked for scrambled eggs, instead I got overcooked fried eggs which also [[killed]] the entree. \n\n\nI'm going to give them another chance next week, and if the same problem presists I'll probably stop eating here again.

MGM....Grand...hmmm? Let's omit the adjective \""grand\"". \nIf you booked a promotional deal and did not receive it upon check-in, demand to speak to management either at the time or later on that evening to receive any promotional coupons promised. \nAll the food at the buffet tasted the same. yuck! \nOur view was of a wall and air conditioning units in the West Wing (4th floor). \nLazy river pool closes at 6pm. \nLimited amount of waitresses on the casino floors \n\nHappy times: Been here four other times and this was my first time writing a poor review. But perhaps it is because the economy is down. Let's stay classy Vegas. Again, not the worse place to stay, but come on, a wall for a view. Give me a break...

Well I used to [[like]] this mall, however, they have \""new\"" owners.The prior owner and manager turned out to be a real crook and stole revenue from many dealers. This all happened about a year - year and half ago. After a big fallout, nearly half the mall moved out. Enter the \""new\"" owners, who I hear are from Texas? These people have tons of stuff, that apparently they have been selling out of state prior, most of it is from their own collections one could gather?  Slowly they have been staging their merchandise to look like individual collections and dealers for months. Over the past year what was left of the original dealers have since moved out, to other malls. The prices are higher than all the malls in Arizona. Perhaps they think they are in California? Santa Fe? They run an Auction service through the mall, but be careful, a good amount of the action items come from the floors and walls of the mall. They also have an Antique Store on eBay under the store name: Continental Collectibles and under the seller name of azantiquecentre. Just check out there eBay approval rating...OVER 500 [[NEGATIVE]] [[ratings]] from customers. It's almost unheard of to have a rating under 90% (their rating is 87%) on eBay without doing something wrong. Pretty sad if you ask me?  So this afternoon I venture into their store, I have not been in the place for 6-8 months prior. On my way out, I was \""Detained\"" because they thought I had stolen a [[piece]] of [[art]] on [[July]] 1st. [[They]] had a [[blurry]] security camera [[photo]] that was kinda close but as I pointed out, without my reading glasses on, that there were MAJOR differences. But they called the Scottsdale police anyway. I'm 68 year old male and have [[never]] been [[arrested]] for anything in my life. I was shocked that they would not spend a few seconds comparing the photo with the person standing in front of them. After an hour of questioning and harassment the cops let me go. [[A]] bad experience in a bad Antique Mall that will remain bad as long as it's current owners and manger run it. If you don't think so, then just ask all of the former dealers that use to rent spaces from them. Currently I think there are maybe three or four left. 90% of that inventory comes from these \""new\"" owners.

I absolutely [[LOVED]] [[staying]] at the Vdara, and will [[absolutely]] be [[back]].  \n\nFirst off... if you're a smoker or a gambler, this [[may]] not be your thing, but for someone like me who doesn't smoke and really couldn't care less about being in a casino... this was AWESOME.  \n\nWe arrived in Vegas at about 10am on a Wednesday and right from the time we arrived in the hotel lobby, things went really, really well.  The person who was helping us with checking in was very friendly, chatty and very [[personable]].  And, she  arranged to get us upgraded to a room that was one level above what we had booked, but because it was so early in the morning our room wasn't ready yet.  [[No]] worries - off to the pool!  \n\nWhen the room was eventually ready, we were duly impressed.  On the 51st floor and overlooking the Bellagio fountain with a super comfy bed and TVs on both the bed side as well as the living room side of the room... it was perfect.  There were only 2 very minor complaints about the room: one - that the water pressure coming out of the shower was pretty lame (though this was made up for by the fact that the water was HOT within seconds of turning it on); and two - that there weren't robes already provided in the room.  Minor, I know - but I'm a girl who likes to relax in a robe and slippers, and quite frankly, every other hotel I've stayed at on the strip in Vegas has just provided them in the room already.  Not a big deal as you can call down to housekeeping and have some brought up for you, but when you're fresh out of the shower and just want a soft, comfy robe to put on you want it already there in the room.  First world problems.  \n\nOther REALLY good things about this place were the concierge service people.  They seriously rocked.  Not only did they get our Cirque Du Soleil tickets printed for us and have them ready, but also made a reservation for us at a steak restaurant in a competing hotel that had NO reservations available when we tried to book earlier in the night.  Wifi was free in the rooms, and I was able to pick up signal in both the pool and lobby areas by just logging on with our last name and room number.  I also loved the pool area - there were tons of lounge chairs, umbrellas to put up when it got stupid hot in the sun, and the waitresses were always happy to bring drinks.   The mojitos were fabulous!!  \n\nIn short - I was sad to leave.  I would have stayed for another few days if only I had that much vacation time to take, but alas, as of Saturday night it was back to reality.  \n\nThanks to the staff at Vdara - we'll definitely be back!

When our son started here 2 years ago it was amazing . The instructors were phenomenal and my son really LOVED karate.  They pushed several competitions throughout the year so we decided to train for one and try it.  My son was only 4 at the time of his first competition.  We paid A LOT of money on top of the already expensive tuition to have one on one sessions to train for competition.  When it came time for the competition we found out they don't send their instructors and we were completely on our own.  EVERY other studio sends instructors along with a team of supporters for their competitors.  We continued to compete, and the kids who represented Sandoval usually ended up with first place wins.  Their training and trainer was amazing, but was often denied permission to attend competitions.  The kids were NEVER recognized for their achievements on their website or Facebook page.  Karate was my son's main passion and now it's really [[fizzled]] out.  He was in the same class for over 9 months and had so many younger/new kids join that he completely dominated the class when the sparred.... not in a good way because it didn't make him any better of a fighter.

Because of the coffee, service , and the limited # of goodies I have tried so far, plus their community involvement,  I am giving this place 5 stars.\nThe patio is very small  with a nice fountain and you can bring your dog - After your coffee take Fido across the street for a bath at Wag-N-Wash (but that is a different review).

After reading so many great reviews I was [[excited]] to try this place, we passed by it a hundred times because it shares the shopping plaza with our favorite Chicago-style pizza place, Amore. We dined in on a week night, we were told booths were reserved but we had our choice of table. We got seated and looked over the menu, we narrowed down our selections and waited, and waited, and waited for someone to take our order.\n\nFinally, our server appeared, we wanted a few rolls: Kiss Me, Lisa Lisa, and WSOP.  She told us not to choose Kiss Me, she says many don't like it. She suggested GT-R, instead. Fine by us, our diet cokes were soon delivered. They had an odd taste, like peppermint or something. Our rolls arrived and we dug in, it was only the WSOP roll we were fond of, it had yellowtail and jalapeno. We were still hungry, but we asked for the check, we were put-off by this point. Our total was $40 for two drinks and three rolls. The rolls were not [[worth]] $12.50, pricey, especially to leave hungry... I'll [[stick]] to Hokaido Sushi, it's closer to home, tastier and a better value. I paid the tab, and my husband placed an order for a pizza. So, we did not go hungry, but it was an expensive appetizer.

Although the coupon does not state this info anywhere in sight...?! It simply says \""delivery charge may apply\"".

One of my favorite spots in Charlotte for sushi! Their sushi lunch buffet is delicious and garlic noodles are a must. Try out their mixed drinks as they always have something new and fresh! The sushi is very fresh and the atmosphere is unique in Charlotte. Their new lounge and jellyfish tank are must-see while enjoying Pisces' food.

This is the [[worst]] I hop I have even in ,its on the  south side  of the strip I was leaving Vegas around 11:00am parking was really bad because its located is a area where there is a outlet in the rear plus other restaurants I spent about 3 to 4 mins .looking for a parking space, there was a line to put your name on the list to be seated that took about 20 mins. order food came out in about 20 mins. food was just OK but you know even bad food taste good if you are really hungry. I had to wait about 10 to pay my bill, the staff was very nice and friendly.

I am warning anyone that loves their Pet to NEVER go to this hospital for any type of service for your pet.  I took my dog there to have some simple fatty cell lumps removed and it was a disaster.  They offered us a discounted rate if we also had our dog's teeth cleaned.  Well, my dog got SEPSIS (blood poisoning) from them infecting him while they were cleaning his teeth and my dog passed away 48 hours later.  I loved my dog for 8 years and he was healthy and happy prior to them infecting him with this deadly disease.  I had a necropsy (autopsy) done to prove their negligence and offered this to them and they provided me with no apologies and tried to do everything they could to deny wrong doing.  I am now fighting with them over reimbursement for my loss since that is all I have left.  I fear that I am not the only one and the public needs to know what the doctors and their non-caring staff have done to pets in their care.  Please do not make the same mistake I made!!

I've gone to the Diamond an many occasions, and it has always been spotty.  One visit terrible, one visit pretty good, but never great.  After my visit this past weekend, I guess I'm calling it quits.  The bottom line is that it's not worth going to a place when the odds are the service and food will sorely disappoint.  \n\nWe had two people visiting from out of town, and forgot Dish was closed, so we figured \""hey, the Diamond wasn't too bad last time, let's go there.\""  Luckily, there was no wait, the four of us sat down, asked what the specials were and it turned out they were out of the specials.  Two of us then ordered the black bean burger.  They were out of that too.  We got some other stuff, and a starter of fried pickles, which were okay.  My friend asked the waiter if the tomatoes were fresh, because she was thinking about a BLT.  The waiter seemed offended and gave a dismissive,  \""yes.\""  Then we waited and waited for the food.  It took way too long to come out.\n\nWe finally got our dishes.  I was okay with mine, but everyone else was very disappointed.  It was as if Diamond shops for the absolute bottom-rung ingredients.    If you put a salad on a menu, it should be at least somewhat appetizing.  The small block burger was a sad, ugly  thing.  The tomatoes were hard and without much flavor.  One person at our table referred to the general quality of the food as \""disgusting.\""  I was embarrassed to have brought friends there.\n\nThe take-away lesson here is that it's great to be a local institution.  It's great to have cool decor and a loyal clientele.  But if you're a restaurant, it's still all about the food for most of your patrons.  You need to have quality food.  And don't think you can get away with serving mediocre grub just because you call yourself a diner.  Especially when you're charging $9 or more for some plates.  A lot of real diners serve superior food at half the price.\n\nSo the Diamond is still a great place to get a drink, but they've got to overhaul nearly everything when it comes to their food.
